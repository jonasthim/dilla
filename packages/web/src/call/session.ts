// The page call session (L-WEB-50): it owns the LiveKit Room through @dilla/media’s joinCall, and the media keys
// through the key relay (keys.ts). Order matters at both ends:
// - join: subscribe onCallKeys, then send callJoin (the join key is a callKeys push posted just before callJoin’s
//   answer), then joinCall with that key and minEpoch = the join epoch;
// - leave: a person’s leave posts callLeave before the room disconnects; a block or removal stops media first and
//   posts callLeave after, because keys must stop before anything else then.
// No key byte reaches the state, a log or an error here: keys.ts holds the only copies and zero-fills them.
// This module is loaded only through load.ts (L-WEB-51), so livekit-client and RNNoise stay out of the entry chunk.
