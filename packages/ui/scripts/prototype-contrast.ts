/**
 * Ruling Y (prototype parity, Jonas 2026-10-27), task 7: the conversation's prototype-exact colours below 4.5:1 in signal.
 * `selector` is the element exactly, for scripts/story-a11y.ts, which turns colour-contrast off for it in signal only and
 * still runs every other rule on it. `simple` is a one-class selector Storybook's own a11y pass (.storybook/preview.tsx,
 * every theme) can put in a `:not()`; the runner above keeps light and high-contrast strict. No imports: Storybook bundles it.
