//! The delivery service a test client talks to, behind one trait with two implementations.
//!
//! `DsStub` is an in-memory **test double**, not a specification: it covers R20's week-1 subset of
//! protocol/02 and nothing else — registration with the binding (invariant 1, minus the
//! `mode_readable` channel check), the tree service (invariant 2), one commit per epoch
//! (invariant 3), the KeyPackage directory (Role 1, not an invariant) and the structural clause of
//! invariant 4. The rest of invariant 4's commit-validity rules, and invariants 5-11, belong to
//! `dillad`; the stub methods that would enforce them succeed without checking, and the two it
//! cannot model at all (`fork_report`, `heal`) refuse with `DsError::Unsupported`.
//!
//! `HttpDs` (`remote.rs`) is the same trait over the real `/v1` surface and the gateway, so one
//! scenario file runs against both. A scenario selects it with `ds <url>` or the CLI's `--ds`.
