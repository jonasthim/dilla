// web3.8, E2: a tab speaking an older wire version than the host offers is told so, and the reload it offers keeps the work.
// The current browser bundle offers wires 4, 3 and 2. A host started with `-wire 5` offers a newer, unsupported wire, so the
// client is refused two ways: the hello has no common version (the client closes the socket itself), and the server closes
// 4006. Both
// put the worker offline with reason 'version' (no reconnect loop), and the page shows `shell.banner.clientTooOld` with
// `reload.action`. Pressing it checkpoints the draft first (WS3), so the draft is back after the page has reloaded.
// Ada's account lives in /tmp/dw/host-8515, which the three hosts of this suite share (`keepData`).
