// E-reload (web3.7, R31): a reload in a call leaves exactly one tile for the reloaded person, and a reload that is
// never followed by a rejoin leaves no ghost either. The second half blocks both page-leave events, `pagehide` and
// `beforeunload` (an init script that stops them before any other listener sees them), so it models a tab that vanishes
// with no leave at all, whatever any listener on the page (the app's, or LiveKit's `disconnectOnPageLeave`) would do.
// FX-RELOAD (web3.9): with `beforeunload` let through, LiveKit's page-leave disconnect ended the room, the old worker
// sent its own self-Remove, and when that won the race (Firefox in CI, run 39393759704) the new page had nothing to
// sweep. Locally the SFU still drops the reloaded participant within about 300 ms, so without help the peer-visible
// checks (bob's roster and tiles) could not tell the sweep from the SFU. The second half therefore holds back the SFU's
// `participant_left` webhook (S3's test-host hook, `withholdLeft`): the instance never hears of the departure, and only
// alice's boot sweep (her self-Remove, one read and one proposal) can take her old device out of bob's roster. That
// roster check is red with the sweep's Remove stubbed (web3.8 E1, recorded in E1-report.md). The request check still
// pins that the sweep reads the call, and that nothing of alice's is proposed before it; sweep.test.ts covers the
// self-Remove.
