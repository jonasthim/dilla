// Lesson d (the leaked-contexts lesson, media suite): a context a test opens itself outlives the test unless the test
// closes it, still joined to its LiveKit room and still encoding, and every later test runs slower beside it. Each voice
// spec closes what it opened in `finally` (peer-browser.ts); these hooks prove it: after each test the worker's browser
// holds exactly as many contexts as before it.
