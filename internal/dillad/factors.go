// each of the person's devices has its gateway sockets closed 4003 (the code a re-identify would
// meet, not resumable, so the next connect is refused E_FACTOR_REQUIRED) and is queued to leave
// every live call, because a LiveKit token minted before the reset would otherwise stay good at
// /rtc until it expires. Sessions are kept (D5). `dillad admin` is another process and cannot
// reach this method: there the gateway's liveness sweep does the same on its next tick.
