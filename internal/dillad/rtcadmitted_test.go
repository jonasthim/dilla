// M-2 of the integration re-review: the proxy tells the call gate a join was admitted only once its
// own checks after AdmitRoom passed — the token's grants and the client's signalling protocol. A join
// it refuses (here a protocol no dilla client sends, and a token wider than the device holds) is
// never recorded, so it can neither hold a device's join window open nor push the device's real
// admission out of the few the call routes remember; a join it lets through is recorded once.
