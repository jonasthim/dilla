// RelayRevocations is what the relay knows about devices that lost the right to it (task 13 review
// I1). It is created once by the composition root and shared by the relay (StartTURN) and the call
// routes (api.Calls.WithRelay).
//
// Every time it holds is a unix time in milliseconds, the unit of the issue time a credential
// carries ("<expiry_s>:<device_id>:<issued_ms>"), and none is ever ahead of the clock: a mint's
// issue time is the clock's, a cut's time is the clock's at the latest (re-review N1).
//
//   - A cut (Revoke) records device → cut time. The relay's auth handler refuses every method of a
//     credential issued at or before its device's cut, and the device's live relay sockets are
//     closed at once: pion then deletes their allocations (allocation.go:375-381), which fires
//     OnAllocationDeleted and so frees the quota slots and moves the gauge. A credential issued
//     after the cut passes, which only a device that may take part in calls again can get. An
//     entry is dropped once turn.max_allocation_age has passed since the cut, when no credential
//     issued before it is honoured anyway, and never before; a cut that cannot be stored raises
//     the floor for every device instead (relayCutsWarn, maxRelayCuts). A
//     socket created for an Allocate that passed the auth handler just before a cut is refused
//     when it is tracked (track), so a cut leaves no socket of an earlier credential open.
//   - The floor starts at the process start (re-review N3): the cuts are held in memory only, so
//     every credential minted before this process started is refused. A restart drops every call
//     anyway (the SFU is in-process); clients re-POST the calls route for a fresh credential.
//   - Mint chooses a credential's issue time under the lock Revoke takes, so every cut is ordered
//     before or after it. It refuses — no credential, and the call route answers a transient 429 —
//     when the device has a live cut in the current millisecond or since the request began, which
//     the credential would otherwise be ordered against by luck.
//   - The barred lookup (WithBarred) covers what no cut reaches — a device another process revoked
//     that is in no call room. It is asked (through a cache of barredTTL) only about a device whose
//     request pion has authenticated — the OnAuth event, after the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY check — and,
//     every barredTTL, about each device that holds relay sockets; a barred device is cut. The
//     auth handler itself, which pion calls before the integrity check, reads the cut map only, so
//     no unauthenticated request causes a store read or a cache entry. A lookup that fails, times
//     out or finds the bound of lookups in flight reached caches nothing and is logged at WARN: the
//     relay never waits on the database, and such a device is bounded by turn.max_allocation_age
//     until a later lookup succeeds. The cut map stays authoritative whatever the lookup says.
