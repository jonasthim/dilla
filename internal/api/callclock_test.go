// The instance clock and the SFU's clock are two clocks. LiveKit stamps a participant's join with
// its own (the in-process SFU reads the process's wall clock); the instance stamps an admission
// with Options.Clock. The test host freezes that one and moves it forward (advance_clock, a TOTP
// pick that waits for the next period), so it can run ahead of LiveKit's: a session's join then
// reads as earlier than its admission, its leave is bound to no membership, and its leaf stays in
// the call group (the remote tile that never went in leave-reload after blocked.spec).
