// ResolverACL is the real ds.ACL: invariant 4's "a credential whose user is
// eligible under the channel's ACL", answered by the permission resolver over
// roles and channel overwrites. It replaces Plan 1's ds.DenyUnlessMember (NV-B6)
// as the eligibility check for an Add, for a join by external commit (resync)
// and for the GroupInfo and tree a joiner reads. Like StructureChannels it lives
// in internal/api, because internal/ds must not learn the permission vocabulary
// it keeps behind the seam.
//
// The rules, by the group's kind (protocol/01 "Group kinds"):
//
//   - text, in a community: the group's target is a live channel of the group's
//     community and the user holds PermViewChannel in it, overwrites applied.
//   - call, in a community: the same with PermViewChannel|PermConnect. The
//     target is the voice channel (protocol/01 dilla_binding; R9 keeps the call
//     id in a companion column, never in target_id), so a call group whose
//     channel is gone is refused exactly as a text group is. There is no
//     community-wide fallback: it would drop the channel's overwrites and open
//     a deleted private voice channel's group to every member.
//   - text or call with no community, bound to a live DM or group DM: the DM's
//     participants, task 6's channel_members, which the resolver answers with
//     the DM bits (Resolver.resolveDM).
//   - everything else — a pairing group, an interaction group, a DM-shaped
//     group whose target is no channel — keeps Plan 1's rule: eligible only
//     where the user is already in the group.
//
// An error means "cannot answer", which every caller in internal/ds treats as a
// refusal.
