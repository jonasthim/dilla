// UploadMeter is the per-user upload meter of [blobs] (fix wave C7): uploads_per_minute is a
// request bucket and upload_bytes_per_day a byte bucket, both token buckets that refill
// continuously and start full. A PUT reserves one request and the bytes it may write before a
// byte of the body is read, and settles the byte reservation to what was actually read once the
// upload is over, so bytes the instance read and then refused (a hash mismatch, a quota refusal
// after the body), orphaned, or later deleted all spend the budget: deleting an attachment frees
// quota, never the day's budget. A zero or negative setting turns its bucket off.
//
// The buckets live in memory: a restart refills them. Their number is bounded by the enrolled
// users who uploaded since the process started.
//
// One meter serves every route that stores uploaded bytes under their hash: the attachment PUT and
// PUT /v1/backups (security review F3), so a user's budget is one budget whichever route spends it.
