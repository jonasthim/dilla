// registerInstance already guards `d.Config != nil` when it decides whether
// GET /v1/instance is enrolled-only, so a Deps without a Config is a shape the
// package's own routing table admits — and three tests in this package build
// exactly that. Both handlers then read d.Config.Auth, d.Config.Instance and
// d.Config.Limits unconditionally, which is a nil dereference: in production
// server.Recover turns it into a 500, but internal/api mounts no Recover, so
// the panic takes the whole test binary down instead of failing one test.
//
// The precedent is TestDeleteMeWithoutAConfigRefusesRatherThanSkippingTheStepUp
// in accounts_delete_test.go: a missing config fails CLOSED with a 500.
