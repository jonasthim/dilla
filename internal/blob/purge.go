// commit it unlinks the file.
//
// The tombstone is not optional: without it, anyone still holding the
// ciphertext re-PUTs it and content addressing hands back the same name. A purge
// of bytes the instance does not hold still writes the tombstone, which makes
// the table the operator's hash blocklist (gap-47 §7.3). A second purge of the
// same bytes is harmless: the first tombstone stands and the audit log records
// both acts.
//
// Every attachment is encrypted under a random per-attachment key, so the same
// file sent by someone else has a different blob_id. A purge removes BYTES, not
// CONTENT.
