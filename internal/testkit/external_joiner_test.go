// Invariant 4's Add clause applied to the leaf an external commit creates (deviation B36,
// checkExternalJoiner in internal/ds/commit.go). internal/ds cannot write these: its tests drive
// the delivery service with committed fixtures, which hold no external commit, and a refusal that
// happens AFTER the merge — which is where this clause runs, because the merged tree is the first
// place the joiner's leaf exists — needs a real one. Each case is a real dilla-core client whose
// external commit breaks exactly one part of the clause, uploaded to the in-process instance.
//
// Every case then has a well-formed external join accepted and a message decrypted: a refusal
// after the merge rolls the transaction back and evicts the merged handle, and a group that kept
// the refused leaf would fail right there.
