	// recorded, so any Remove of L removes that device: the outcome is the one the DS's Remove has.

	//     unreachable and `reissueOmitted` can never fire.
	//  2. R25's resync, which is exempt from the freeze under its own two guards and re-issues
	//     the outstanding proposals for the new epoch immediately afterwards (`reissueAll`).
	//
	// The freeze's own answer is what decides case 1 — never an unconditional external carve-out,
