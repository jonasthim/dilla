// The commit path is exercised against the committed 1,500-leaf fixture, which is the only real
// MLS material this repository holds. What it gives and what it withholds shapes every test here:
//
//   - commits/00..07 are 256-Add batches, commits/08 a Remove of leaf 1, commits/09 a self-update
//     with no proposals at all. All ten are alternatives at the fixture's base epoch 6.
//   - group_info.mls is the GroupInfo of epoch 6, signed by leaf 0.
//
// There is NO GroupInfo at epoch 7, so no commit in this repository can be accepted: invariant 4's
// sixth clause wants epoch n+1 and the fixture stops at n. Every clause that fires BEFORE the
// merge is therefore assertable here and the accepted path is not; task 20's report records the
// gap and names the fixture work that closes it. The two clauses with no committed material at all
// — the committer's own Update, and a GroupInfo signed by another leaf — are skipped by name
// rather than dropped, so the hole is visible in the test output instead of only in prose.
