// reconcilePage is how many open groups one sweep tick reconciles. The sweeper ticks every minute
// and the reconcile asks the ACL once per distinct user of each group, so it walks the open groups
// a page per tick, resuming where the last tick stopped, rather than the whole instance every
// minute.
const reconcilePage = 64

// reconcileLeaves is the backstop for a membership change whose Removes were never issued (fix
// wave C3). A kick, a ban or a leave commits first and proposes its Removes afterwards; if that
// second half dies — a crash, a fault in the middle of the loop — nothing else re-drives it: the
// ACL gates only Adds and joins, commit and upload check only leaf currency, and the inactivity
// sweep skips active devices. So each tick takes the next page of open text and call groups and,
// in each, proposes an instance Remove for every live leaf whose user the ACL no longer admits and
// that no outstanding INSTANCE Remove already targets. A member's own Remove of the leaf does not
// count: a member proposal never stands in for an instance proposal.
//
// A group the ACL admits nobody to is left alone: it is the leftover of a deleted channel whose
// Close was lost, and emptying it leaf by leaf would only queue Removes nobody could commit.
// An epoch-unknown group is skipped too: it heals first.
//
// THE BARRED DEVICES (R-2 of the DS re-review). In every open text and call group (DMs included), a
// live leaf whose DEVICE is quarantined or revoked is owed an instance Remove whatever the ACL says
// of its user, and this pass is the durable source of it. Pairing and interaction groups carry no
// external sender (protocol/01 § External senders), so their members reject an instance Remove and
// the guest refuses to issue one: they are not asked (M-1 of the integration re-review), and their
// own members remove a revoked device (01, member Removes: a device revocation). A fork quorum
// fires once and proposes once; nothing proposes a revoked device's removal at all (revocation closes its sockets and cuts it
// from calls, and the user-level ACL still admits its user); and a heal can drop a restored
// Remove whose re-issue failed, or orphan it in a crash before the carry. One query per group
// (ListBarredMembers), and the Remove is bound to the device and deduped like every other.
