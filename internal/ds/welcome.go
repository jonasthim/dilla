// welcome.go is the delivery service's store-and-forward of Welcomes: protocol/02's role 4,
// endpoints 15 (`GET /v1/welcomes`) and 16 (`DELETE /v1/welcomes/{welcome_id}`), and the writer
// the commit's own transaction calls.
//
// Three facts shape the whole file (gap-13).
//
//  1. A Welcome blob is IDENTICAL for every joiner of one commit, so 256 joiners share ONE payload
//     row keyed by its SHA-256 and get 256 cheap pointers at it. Storing the body 256 times is how
//     a join storm fills a disk.
//  2. A dilla Welcome carries NO ratchet tree, and the live tree moves on with every commit, so
//     the tree of the welcoming epoch is stored beside the Welcome and served with it.
//  3. A fetch does NOT consume. `StagedWelcome::new_from_welcome` consumes the key material inside
//     the client even when the client then fails, so only the explicit DELETE marks one delivered.
