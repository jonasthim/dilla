// Every test in this file issues an instance proposal FIRST. RequestCommit returns immediately on
// a group with no outstanding proposals —
//
//	refs, _ := d.refsOf(...); if len(refs) == 0 { d.clearElection(groupID); return nil }
//
// — so calling it on a proposal-free group sends no mls.commit_needed at all, and
// h.expectDeviceFrames would time out on every one of them. h.proposeRemoveOf issues an instance
// Remove, whose storeInstanceProposal already ends in RequestCommit, so the frame under test is
// the one that call produced. `h.groupWithMembers` issues one seed Remove of its own, of a leaf no
// test names, so that TestTheWatchdogNudgesTheNextCandidate — which calls RequestCommit without
// proposing anything — has something to elect for too; see the helper.
//
// TWO TESTS OF THE BRIEF WERE CARRIED. Both were ASSIGNED, in the plan's part-1b deviation table
// and in the SDD workspace rulings:
//
//   - TestTheBackoffWindowIsAdvertisedInHello -> TASK 27a (deviation B23, ruling 44). It is at the
//     end of this file, verbatim from the plan's task 22 step 1, and landed with the `hello`
//     7 -> 9 amendment and the `Backoff`/`BackoffJitter` fields on `gateway.Options`.
//   - TestACommitThatReissuesAnOmittedRemoveDoesNotDeadlock -> TASK 25 (deviation B24, ruling 45),
//     in the same commit that exempts `checkAppliedProposals`' clause 1 for
//     `o.external && !frozen` (B21) and beside the merged GroupInfo the fixture owes. The comment
//     on `reissueOmitted` (internal/ds/freeze.go) states the property it guards.
//
// Why neither could be written here:
//
//   - TestTheBackoffWindowIsAdvertisedInHello asserts backoff_ms and backoff_jitter_ms as two new
//     elements of the `hello` payload. `hello` is a SEVEN-element frame in protocol/02 §2.3 (line
//     133), in gateway.HelloPayload, in opSpecs[OpHello], in packages/protocol-vectors/src/
//     frames.ts and in the committed protocol/vectors/frames.json the Rust guest's vectors_check
//     reads — adding two elements is a wire amendment across three languages and a wasm rebuild,
//     with no seam for Policy.Backoff to reach the gateway (gateway.Options has no such field).
//     Task 22's Files are three new files in internal/ds; the amendment is not made here.
//   - TestACommitThatReissuesAnOmittedRemoveDoesNotDeadlock needs an EXTERNAL commit the delivery
//     service accepts. commit.go step (6) refuses every commit whose processed.SenderLeaf is nil
//     ("the committer's leaf is unknown, so the GroupInfo's signer cannot be checked") and
//     freeze.go says of reissueOmitted, in terms: "IT CANNOT FIRE UNTIL TASK 25 (deviation B21,
//     ruling 42)". There is also no external-commit blob in testkit/fixtures/ds-1500 and no MLS
//     client in Go to make one. The deadlock it guards is nonetheless real, and the lock-free
//     `proposeRemoveLocked` it depends on is already in place and commented for it.
//
// Both are reported to the reviewer as carried work, with the exact shape each needs.
