// ACL is the eligibility half of invariant 4's Add clause: "a credential whose user is eligible
// under the channel's ACL". The resolver is Plan 2's — permissions live with the structure tables
// — so the clause is an injected seam. The composition root injects api.ResolverACL, the
// permission resolver over roles and channel overwrites (Plan 2 task 3, NV-B6 closed); a DS built
// without one falls back to DenyUnlessMember, which admits a user only where the instance can
// already see them in the group. That default is deliberately conservative: a permissive one
// would leave a security clause of invariant 4 silently unimplemented, which is the one outcome
// worse than a strict one.
//
// It is declared here, with its Plan-1 stub, because ds.Options names the seam (deviation D16),
// so the package does not build without it. Task 20's brief
// re-declares this interface beside checkAddedMember, which is its first caller; that step is a
// check against this declaration, not a second one.

	// Eligible reports whether userID may be added to groupID. An error means "the resolver

// DenyUnlessMember is the Plan-1 ACL: a user is eligible only where the instance can already see
// them as a member of the group. That admits the ordinary re-add of a device belonging to a user
// already in the group and refuses everything else (NV-B6). It is the default of a DS built with
// no ACL, and api.ResolverACL still answers with it for the groups the resolver has no rule for
// (pairing and interaction groups, and a DM-shaped group whose target is no DM channel).
