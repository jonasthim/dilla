// resyncing device is the target of an outstanding non-void instance Remove — otherwise a device
// the instance is evicting could re-add itself forever. Second, the instance re-issues its
// outstanding proposals for the new epoch immediately afterwards, so the freeze that was skipped
// is not lost.
//
// Resync takes the group lock ONCE, for the whole read-guard-commit sequence, which is why it
// calls `commitLocked` rather than `commit`.
//
// Reading the epoch with `d.epochOf` outside the lock and only then calling `d.commit` — which
// takes the lock itself and compares `c.Epoch != row.Epoch` — would let a commit landing between
// the two reads turn a valid resync into a spurious E_COMMIT_CONFLICT, and the device that is
// already out of the epoch is precisely the one that cannot recover from it. `guardResyncTarget`
// would read the group row unlocked too. Every read that feeds commit's epoch comparison happens
