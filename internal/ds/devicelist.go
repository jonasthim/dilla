// DeviceLists decodes and verifies a user's signed device list, which is invariant 4's DSK clause:
// "its DSK is in the newest signed device list". The decoder and the ssk_signature check are the
// core's (`core/dilla-core/src/identity/device_list.rs`), reached through the guest's
// `device_list_entries` export (ABI v3), so the Go side never re-implements the format and cannot
// disagree with the client that produced it.
// Entries reads and verifies the stored newest list; Verify checks a candidate before
// PUT /v1/users/{id}/device-list stores it.
//
// It is declared here, with its Plan-1 implementation, because ds.Options names the seam (the same
// reason as ACL and Channels).

	// v is the guest to verify in. Every caller on the commit and heal paths already holds a wasm
	// instance — the group's own, inside withGroup — and passes it (a *mlswasi.PublicGroup

// attacker-influenced field — and the guest's decoder is what makes the comparison a membership
// test over decoded entries.
