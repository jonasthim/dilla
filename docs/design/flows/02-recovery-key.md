# Flow 02 — the recovery-key ceremony (web-1)

The strings of this document are L-COPY-01 of the web-1 plan, quoted, except `onboarding.keys.loss`, which is L-COPY-02 of the web-2a plan. A change is made there first.

Step 3 of `01-onboarding.md`, drawn in detail. Built by web-1 task 20 (`RecoveryKey` in `@dilla/ui`) and
task 23 (the onboarding screen). The rules come from `protocol/03-identity.md` "Recovery": the key is 256
random bits shown once as 52 Crockford base32 characters in 13 groups of 4, the person must acknowledge
that they wrote it down before continuing, and the screen offers no copy button.

## What is on the screen

- The heading `onboarding.keys.title`, the step line, and the two paragraphs `onboarding.keys.body` and
  `onboarding.keys.loss`, in that order.
- The grid: a label (`onboarding.keys.label`) and an ordered list of the 13 groups exactly as
  `account.recoveryKey` holds them, in order, in upper case. Each group is plain text. The numbers 01–13
  in front of the groups are drawn by CSS and are not part of the text: selecting the whole grid and
  pasting it yields the 13 groups and line breaks, nothing else. While `account.recoveryKey` is still
  `null`, the grid's place holds the status line `onboarding.keys.preparing` (`role="status"`).
- The acknowledgement: a native checkbox labelled `onboarding.keys.acknowledge`, not ticked when the step
  opens.
- The print button `onboarding.keys.print`.
- The footer: `Back`, and `Continue`, which is blocked until the box is ticked: `aria-disabled="true"`,
  never the native `disabled`, so it stays in the tab order and its reason is heard. While it is blocked the
  hint `onboarding.keys.ackHint` stands under it and is its description, and activating it does nothing.

The grid fills the column. Four groups per row at this width (the columns are at least 7.5rem wide and
as many fit as the column allows; no breakpoint decides it). The grid label is drawn in capitals by CSS.

Two groups per row, seven rows; the checkbox label wraps under itself; `Print` sits on its own line.

```

## Type and colour

The groups are `--text-lg` in the mono face with wide letter spacing, `--fg` on `--surface-2` inside a
1px `--edge` border. The numbers are `--text-micro` in `--fg-3`. Nothing in the grid is accent-coloured
and nothing animates. All three themes use the same layout; high contrast draws the border in white.

## Print

`Print` calls the browser's print dialog. The printed page shows the heading, the two paragraphs, the
label and the grid with its numbers; the top bar, the step line, the checkbox, the print button and the
footer are not printed. Nothing is sent anywhere and nothing is written to disk by the page.

The print rules use system colours (`CanvasText` on `Canvas`), because browsers do not print backgrounds and the default theme's text is near-white.

## Keyboard and assistive technology

- Tab order: the grid's text is not a tab stop; Tab goes from the last field above to the checkbox, then
  `Print`, then `Back`, then `Continue` (also while it is blocked, when focus on it reads the hint).
- Space toggles the checkbox; Enter or Space activates `Print`, `Back` and `Continue`.
- A screen reader reads the label `Recovery key` and then a list of 13 items, each one group; the numbers
  are not read (the CSS counter has empty alternative text). The groups can be read character by
  character with the reader's own commands.
- The key is selectable text, so a person who chooses to can select it and paste it into a password
  manager; nothing on the screen invites it.

## What is not offered, and why

| not offered | why |
|---|---|
| a copy button | `protocol/03-identity.md` "Recovery": the client MUST NOT offer one on this screen (DEV-W15, F2). A copy button puts the key on the clipboard, where other programs and clipboard history can read it. Selecting the text by hand stays possible. |
| the 24-word form | F2 defers the word list (DEV-W16); the core has no word list (`core/dilla-core/src/identity/recovery.rs:4-5`). Only the 52-character form is shown. |
| showing the key again later | the key is never stored (plan web-1 ruling 6); once the step is left forward and the account exists, it cannot be shown again |
| a download as a file | a file in a downloads folder is a copy the person did not choose to make |
| a QR code | nothing in web-1 scans one |
| typing the key back to check it | the key is typed only where it is used: signing in on another browser and removing a device (`03-sign-in.md`), where paste is allowed (F2, WCAG 3.3.8) |

## Copy

| key | text |
|---|---|
| `onboarding.keys.title` | `Your recovery key` |
| `onboarding.keys.body` | `This key is shown once and is kept nowhere. Write it down or print it, and keep it away from this computer.` |
| `onboarding.keys.loss` | `This key is the only way to get your account back or to add another browser. If every browser you use loses its data and you do not have the key, the account and its history are gone, and the host cannot bring them back.` |
| `onboarding.keys.label` | `Recovery key` |
| `onboarding.keys.acknowledge` | `I have written down or printed my recovery key` |
| `onboarding.keys.ackHint` | `Tick the box to continue.` |
| `onboarding.keys.print` | `Print` |
| `onboarding.keys.preparing` | `Making your keys` |
