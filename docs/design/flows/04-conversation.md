# Flow 04 — the conversation says more: edit, delete, react, reply, pin, mention, attach (web-2b)

The strings and the flow rules of this document began as L-COPY-03 of the web-2b plan, quoted. From web-2b task 8 on this
document's Copy table is the record of these strings, held equal to `en.ts` by `copy.test` (task 9 adds this file to its
flow list); a change is made here and in `en.ts` together.

How a person edits, deletes, reacts to, replies to and pins messages, mentions people, roles and everyone (`@everyone`
from the autocomplete, a typed `@here` counting as everyone), and sends and opens images and files in a channel or a
direct message. Wireframed before it is built (F16). Built by web-2b task 8 (the components in `@dilla/ui`) and task 9
(the conversation in `packages/web/src/screens/conversation/` and the strings in `packages/web/src/strings/en.ts`). The
shell around it is web-1's; the badges and notifications are web-2a's.

Every user-visible string is a key of `packages/web/src/strings/en.ts`; the "Copy" table at the end is the exact English
text. `{name}` is a member's display name, else their username; `{channel}` a channel's name; `{count}` and `{n}` numbers;
`{code}` an error code such as `E_BLOB_OPEN`; `{size}` a size made by `shell.attachment.bytes`, `.kb` or `.mb`; `{id}` the
first eight hexadecimal characters of an id the device cannot name.

The wireframes write each string as the Copy table has it. Chrome labels are lower case (Q14): the toolbar, the reaction
names, the tray phases, the reply chip, the mention list, the card actions, the pins button. Dialog surfaces are sentence
case: the delete dialog, the pins dialog's heading and empty text, the lightbox's buttons, the tray's refusals. Nothing in
this flow says how messages or files are protected (F10): no lock, no "secure", no "encrypting".

## Entry

The conversation is the main pane of the shell for an open channel or DM whose group is `active` (web-1). Every control
below is offered only there; a channel in any other state shows web-1's states and none of these controls.

## Steps

| the person | the page | the worker command (L-TS-35) |
|---|---|---|
| activates `react` on a row, or the `+` of its reaction bar | opens the emoji grid next to the control | — |
| picks an emoji in the grid | closes the grid, focus back to the control that opened it | `react` with `on` = not already `mine` |
| activates a reaction chip | toggles it | `react` with `on` = not `mine` |
| activates `reply` | shows the reply chip above the composer, focus to the composer | — (the next `send` carries `replyTo`) |
| activates `edit` on an own row, or presses `ArrowUp` in an empty composer | replaces the body by the editor, focus in it | — |
| saves the editor (`Enter` or `save`) | closes the editor; the row shows `saving…` until the edit is folded | `editMessage` |
| activates `pin` / `unpin` | — | `pin` with `on` true / false |
| activates `delete` on an own row | opens the delete dialog | — |
| confirms `Delete` | closes the dialog; the row shows `saving…` until the delete is folded | `deleteMessage` |
| activates `pinned` in the header | opens the pins dialog | `loadPins` (and `closePins` when it closes) |
| activates `go to message` in the pins dialog | closes it, scrolls to the row and flashes it for 1.4 s | — |
| types `@` and letters in the composer | opens the mention list | — |
| picks a person (`Enter`, `Tab` or a click) | inserts `@username ` | — |
| activates `attach files`, drops files on the main pane, or pastes files into the composer | the tray lists them by phase | `attachFiles` |
| removes a tray entry | — | `discardAttachment` |
| sends | the message with its ready files; the tray empties | `send` with `attachments` and `replyTo` |
| activates an image card | opens the lightbox with the full image | `openAttachment` (`thumb` false) |
| activates `save` on a file card or in the lightbox | the browser saves the file under its shown name | `openAttachment` (`thumb` false) |
| activates the reply line of a row | scrolls to the original and flashes it | — |

Nothing is shown as done before the worker's timeline says so: an edit, a delete, a reaction or a pin in flight is the
row's state text (`saving…`), never the result. A pin is visible to everyone in the conversation and anyone in it may
unpin it; the pins dialog says who pinned. A delete removes the message, its reactions and its files for everyone,
including devices that come online later; a copy someone saved stays theirs.

The shell's narrow layout (web-1): the main pane alone. The toolbar sits in flow on its own line under the head of the
active row (never over the row above); cards fill the width; the lightbox and the dialogs fill the viewport.

## States

| state | what the row or control shows |
|---|---|
| an edit, delete, reaction or pin in flight (an outbox fold, pending) | the target row's state text `saving…` (`shell.message.saving`); nothing else changes until the fold arrives |
| the same, failed | `not saved` (`shell.message.notSaved`) with `retry` and `discard` (web-1's `shell.message.retry`, `.discard`) |
| edited | `edited` in the head; the body is the latest edit |
| pinned | `pinned` in the head |
| a reply whose original is held | the reply line `↳ {name} {excerpt}`; activating it jumps |
| a reply whose original is further back than the loaded page | the jump shows `shell.message.replyNotLoaded` as an info banner above the log, with a dismiss action |
| a reply whose original cannot be shown here (never received, or not readable on this device) | the reply line says `the original message cannot be shown here`; it is not a button |
| a reply whose original was deleted | the reply line says `the original message was deleted`; it is not a button |
| an attachment-only message | the cards with no body line |
| an image card before its thumbnail is opened | a neutral box of the image's proportions |
| an image card whose open failed | the box or thumbnail and `could not open ({code})` |
| an attachment over 25 MB received in a browser | the card with `too large to open in a browser` and no button |
| a file picked over 25 MB | nothing is uploaded; an alert above the tray in the composer says `{name} is over 25 MB and cannot be sent from a browser.` |
| a fifth file | nothing is added; the alert says `A message carries at most 4 files.` |
| send while a file is not ready | nothing is sent; the alert says `Wait until every file is ready, or remove it.` |
| a tray entry that failed | `failed ({code})` and, under it, `Remove it and attach it again.` (`shell.tray.failedHint`) |
| a message failed because a file is no longer on the server | `shell.message.attachmentGone` (`A file of this message is no longer on the server. Discard it and attach the file again.`), discard only |
| a mention of me, of a role I hold, `@everyone` or a received `@here` | the pill in the mention colour; the row has the mention bar |
| a mention of someone else | a quiet pill with their `@name` |
| a mention of an id this device cannot name | `@{id}` with its first eight hex characters |
| a role mention | `@role` |

## Keyboard and focus

No single-character key anywhere (WCAG 2.1.4) and no new modifier shortcut (Q14).

- Shell order (web-1): skip link → rail → channel list → header (the `pinned` button after the topic) → log → composer → status bar.
- The log is one tab stop. Entering it focuses the active row (initially the newest). `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` move the active row; `Home` / `End` go to the first and last loaded row; `Escape` on a row goes to the composer.
- Inside the active row, after the row itself: the toolbar (one stop; `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight`, `Home` / `End`), the reply line's button, each attachment card's button, the reaction bar (one stop; `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight` across the chips and `+`). `Escape` inside any of them returns focus to the row. The controls of every other row are not in the tab order; pointers still reach them.
- The toolbar is hidden while the person types in the composer (it never floats over the row above). Shift+Tab from the composer enters the active row at its last visible stop; the toolbar appears once focus is in the log.
- The emoji grid: 8 columns; arrows in two dimensions, `Home` / `End`; `Enter` or `Space` picks; `Escape` closes; focus returns to the control that opened it.
- The editor: `Enter` saves, `Shift+Enter` breaks the line, `Escape` cancels; never during an IME composition; focus returns to the row.
- The composer: `ArrowUp` with an empty value and no open mention list edits the newest own sent message. With the mention list open, `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` move, `Enter` or `Tab` picks, `Escape` closes it; with no list open and a reply chip, `Escape` cancels the reply.
- The composer's textarea keeps its `textbox` role and its name at all times. While the mention list is open it carries `aria-controls` (the list's id), `aria-activedescendant` (the active option) and `aria-autocomplete="list"`; the list is a `listbox` of `option`s and none of them takes focus.
- The delete dialog: focus to the dialog, `Escape` cancels; `Delete` is the last button.
- The pins dialog: focus to the dialog; `Escape` closes; focus returns to the `pinned` button.
- The lightbox: focus to `Close`; `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight` move between the images of the same message; `Escape` closes; focus returns to the card.
- Dropping files is pointer-only; `attach files` and pasting into the composer are the keyboard paths.

When the focused control goes away, focus never falls to the page:

- un-reacting the last chip of a row (the reaction bar goes away) → the row;
- removing a tray entry → the next entry's remove button, else the composer's textarea;
- `cancel reply` → the composer's textarea;
- `unpin` in the pins dialog: the dialog stays open and focus moves to the next item's `unpin`, else to `Close`;
- dismissing the `shell.message.replyNotLoaded` banner → the log's active row;
- `discard` on the `shell.message.attachmentGone` line (the message leaves the log) → the row web-1 hands focus on to (`handOnFromRow`);
- focus leaving the emoji grid (Tab out, or a click elsewhere) closes it without moving focus.

## Announcements

- The log is `role="log"`, polite, with `aria-relevant="additions"` (web-1 plus this flow): a new message is announced;
  a changed reaction count, a pin or an edit's text change is not (they are reflected in the row). A newly inserted node
  inside a row — a first reaction chip, the inline editor, a pending-action line — may be read once as an addition. The
  emoji grid is a popover outside the log and is never read as log content.
- A tray entry's phase is a polite live region: `reading`, `preparing`, `uploading`, `ready`, `failed ({code})`; a failed
  entry adds `Remove it and attach it again.`
- A tray refusal (`shell.tray.tooLarge`, `.tooMany`, `.notReady`) is an alert (`role="alert"`) above the tray in the
  composer; `shell.message.replyNotLoaded` is an info banner above the log with a dismiss action. Neither is shown by
  colour alone.
- A pending action is announced through the row's state text, never by colour alone.

## What is not offered, and why

- Threads, quote reply, forward, "mark unread", "save message", "copy link", a right-click menu: later cards (the toolbar's five actions only).
- Edit history: only the latest edit, marked `edited`.
- A free emoji picker, custom emoji, emoji in the composer, markdown: the fixed 32 reactions and plain text bodies.
- Byte progress for uploads: `fetch` reports none; the tray shows phases.
- Deleting someone else's message: only its author can.
- Files over 25 MB in a browser: refused at the tray, shown as too large on receipt.
- An `@here` option in the mention list: the client has no presence (ruling 29 as amended); a typed `@here` is still sent and counts as everyone.

## Copy

`@everyone` and `@here` are protocol tokens shown verbatim (a mention pill's text, the `everyone` option's primary text in
the mention list): they are not keys of `en.ts` and have no row in this table.
