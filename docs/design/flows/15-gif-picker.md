# Flow 15: the GIF picker and the server's Giphy setting (E8)

GIFs are a per-server setting. A person who manages a server enters that server's Giphy key in its settings; the key is write-only and shown as dots afterwards. A server without a key has no GIF button. Search and the preview and full downloads go through the instance, so Giphy sees the instance and never a person. The picked GIF is attached like any file: it is encrypted like any file, and a reader's browser never contacts giphy.com. There are no GIFs in direct messages.

## States

| State | UI |
|---|---|
| a channel of a server with no Giphy key | no `gif` button in any composer |
| a channel of a server with a Giphy key | a `gif` button (`gif.button`) after the attach `+`, in a channel's composer (a thread's composer has none); the button appears once the server's setting has been read |
| reading the setting fails | no button |
| a direct message or group message, or a thread | never a `gif` button; the setting is not even asked for |
| the composer is blocked (read-only, no permission) | the `gif` button is disabled with the rest of the composer |
| picker open, nothing typed | trending results; the search box (`gif.search`, placeholder `gif.search.placeholder`) is focused; `aria-expanded="true"` on the button |
| searching | `gif.loading` in the status line; results of the last search stay until the new ones arrive |
| results | a grid of three columns, one button per GIF named by its title (`gif.untitled` when it has none); a preview that is still downloading is a plain block, and the previews fill in as they arrive |
| the instance is busy | a preview that was refused as busy is asked for again after a short pause (three tries); the others show meanwhile |
| more results | the `gif.more` button under the grid |
| no results | `gif.empty` in the status line |
| the instance refused the search (key removed, busy, rate limit) | `gif.error` in the status line; typing again retries |
| a GIF picked | the picker shows `gif.picking` and ignores further picks; the full GIF is downloaded through the instance, then added to the file tray like a chosen file; the picker closes and focus goes to the message box |
| the pick failed | the picker stays open with `gif.pickFailed` |
| the GIF is in the tray | the tray shows it as an image file named `giphy-{id}.gif`; Enter in the message box sends it, with or without text; the tray's remove button drops it |
| a reader | sees an ordinary image attachment; nothing marks it as a GIF from a service |
| the picker footer | `gif.powered` |
| a phone | the picker is the width of the screen above the composer; results and buttons are 44px targets |
| server settings → overview, the GIFs row | titled `gif.settings.title` with `gif.settings.hint` and a link `gif.settings.getKey` to Giphy's developer page, below the name and the inactive timeout |
| the row, no key set | a password field `gif.settings.key` (never auto-filled) and `gif.settings.save`; a key that is not 8 to 64 letters and digits is refused in the field with `gif.settings.invalid` |
| the row, a key set | the dots `gif.settings.masked` (named `gif.settings.maskedLabel`) with `gif.settings.replace` and `gif.settings.remove`; the key is never shown again |
| replacing | the field and `gif.settings.save` with `gif.settings.cancel` take the dots' place; the field is empty |
| saved or removed | `gif.settings.saved` or `gif.settings.removed` in the status line; the field is emptied |
| the rating | a select `gif.settings.rating` with `gif.rating.g`, `gif.rating.pg`, `gif.rating.pg-13` (the default) and `gif.rating.r`; changing it saves at once and says `gif.settings.ratingSaved`; it filters search only |
| a person without Manage Server | does not see the row (the settings section is for managers); a refusal from the instance says `gif.settings.forbidden` |
| the instance refuses a change | `gif.settings.error` with the code, never the key |
| the setting cannot be read | `gif.settings.loadError` |

## Keyboard map

- `gif` button: Enter or Space toggles the picker; `aria-haspopup="dialog"`, `aria-expanded` follows, `aria-controls` names the picker while it is open
- Search box: ArrowDown enters the grid
- The grid is one tab stop that follows focus: Arrows move in two dimensions without wrapping, Home and End go to the ends, ArrowUp from the first row goes back to the search box
- A result: Enter, Space or a click picks it
- Escape closes the picker and returns focus to the `gif` button; it goes no further
- The settings row: Tab reaches the field or the dots' buttons in order; Enter in the field saves; Escape in the replace field cancels

## Focus rules

- Opening focuses the search box
- Escape returns focus to the `gif` button
- A pick moves focus to the message box, with the GIF in the tray
- A pointer down outside the picker closes it, except on the `gif` button, which toggles
- Saving a key, removing it or cancelling a replace puts focus on the row's next control (`gif.settings.replace`, `gif.settings.key`)

## Announcements

- The status line is a polite status: it speaks `gif.loading`, `gif.empty`, `gif.picking` and `gif.pickFailed`
- A search failure speaks `gif.error` once
- A GIF added to the tray speaks `gif.added` through the shell announcer
- The settings row says `gif.settings.saved`, `gif.settings.removed` or `gif.settings.ratingSaved` through the shell announcer (the settings body keeps no status region of its own); a refusal is an alert
