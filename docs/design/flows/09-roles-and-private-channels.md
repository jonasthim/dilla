# Flow 09: roles and private channels (v0.1.0-web3.5)

Roles, the permission editor, role assignment, channel permissions, private channels, role mentions and per-server notifications. Chrome is lower case; titles, bodies and refusals are sentence case. Every refusal is handled with its copy key, never with a raw code alone.

## States

| State | What shows | Copy keys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Roles tab hidden | Without manage roles the Roles tab is absent from server settings. | `roles.tab` |
| Roles list loading | A loading line in place of the list. | `roles.loading` |
| Roles list error | The error line with a retry button that reloads the list. | `roles.error.load`, `roles.retry` |
| Roles list | Title, body, then the roles from highest to lowest with @everyone last, each with its member count, edit, move up, move down and delete buttons, and a new role button. | `roles.title`, `roles.body`, `roles.new`, `roles.everyone`, `roles.everyoneHint`, `roles.row.one`, `roles.row.other`, `roles.edit`, `roles.editLabel`, `roles.up`, `roles.upLabel`, `roles.down`, `roles.downLabel`, `roles.delete`, `roles.deleteLabel` |
| Locked rows | A role at or above the viewer's highest role shows the locked note and no actions. | `roles.locked` |
| Move done or failed | Done is announced politely. A failure shows an inline error that names the role. | `roles.moved`, `roles.error.move` |
| Editor, new or edit | A dialog with the name, colour swatches, the two toggles and the permission grid in four groups. A permission the viewer does not hold is disabled with the not-held note. | `roles.editor.titleNew`, `roles.editor.titleEdit`, `roles.editor.name`, `roles.editor.nameHint`, `roles.editor.color`, `roles.editor.colorHint`, `roles.editor.hoist`, `roles.editor.mentionable`, `roles.editor.mentionableHint`, `roles.editor.permissions`, `roles.editor.notHeld`, `roles.editor.save`, `roles.editor.create`, `roles.editor.cancel`, `roles.color.none`, `roles.color.red`, `roles.color.orange`, `roles.color.amber`, `roles.color.green`, `roles.color.teal`, `roles.color.cyan`, `roles.color.blue`, `roles.color.indigo`, `roles.color.purple`, `roles.color.pink`, `roles.color.brown`, `roles.color.grey`, `roles.color.custom`, `perm.group.general`, `perm.group.members`, `perm.group.text`, `perm.group.voice`, `perm.view`, `perm.view.hint`, `perm.send`, `perm.send.hint`, `perm.manageMessages`, `perm.manageMessages.hint`, `perm.pin`, `perm.pin.hint`, `perm.attach`, `perm.attach.hint`, `perm.react`, `perm.react.hint`, `perm.history`, `perm.history.hint`, `perm.connect`, `perm.connect.hint`, `perm.speak`, `perm.speak.hint`, `perm.video`, `perm.video.hint`, `perm.screen`, `perm.screen.hint`, `perm.invite`, `perm.invite.hint`, `perm.kick`, `perm.kick.hint`, `perm.ban`, `perm.ban.hint`, `perm.manageChannels`, `perm.manageChannels.hint`, `perm.manageRoles`, `perm.manageRoles.hint`, `perm.manageServer`, `perm.manageServer.hint`, `perm.auditLog`, `perm.auditLog.hint`, `perm.everyone`, `perm.everyone.hint`, `perm.slowmode`, `perm.slowmode.hint`, `perm.admin`, `perm.admin.hint`, `perm.mute`, `perm.mute.hint`, `perm.move`, `perm.move.hint`, `perm.nicknames`, `perm.nicknames.hint` |
| Editor busy | The submit button shows the busy label and the fields are disabled. | `roles.editor.saving`, `roles.editor.creating` |
| Editor refusals | A `role=alert` error in the dialog. The dialog stays open. | `roles.error.empty`, `roles.error.long`, `roles.error.forbidden`, `roles.error.conflict`, `roles.error.full`, `roles.error.gone`, `roles.error.other` |
| Delete role | A confirm dialog that opens on Cancel, a busy state, a polite done announcement, and an alert on failure. | `roles.deleteTitle`, `roles.deleteBody`, `roles.deleteConfirm`, `roles.deleteBusy`, `roles.deleted`, `roles.error.delete` |
| Assign dialog | A checklist of the server's roles for one member. Roles at or above the viewer's highest role are disabled with the locked note. Each change applies at once. | `roles.menu.assign`, `roles.assign.title`, `roles.assign.body`, `roles.assign.locked`, `roles.assign.close`, `roles.access` |
| Assign, nothing to give | The empty note in place of the checklist. | `roles.assign.none` |
| Assign given, taken and refused | Given and taken are announced politely. Refusals show a `role=alert` error in the dialog and the checkbox returns to its prior state. | `roles.assign.given`, `roles.assign.taken`, `roles.assign.error.forbidden`, `roles.assign.error.twoFactor`, `roles.assign.error.gone`, `roles.assign.error.other` |
| Channel permissions, public | A section in channel settings with the private toggle off, the list of entries (@everyone, roles, people) each with allow, default and deny per permission, an add control and a remove button per entry. | `chperm.title`, `chperm.private`, `chperm.privateHint`, `chperm.who`, `chperm.everyone`, `chperm.member`, `chperm.add`, `chperm.addLabel`, `chperm.remove`, `chperm.removeLabel`, `chperm.none`, `perm.allow`, `perm.inherit`, `perm.deny` |
| Channel permissions, private, and confirms | The toggle on, the private tag beside the channel name. Turning it on or off opens a confirm that opens on Cancel; saving shows the busy label, then the saved announcement. | `chperm.privateTag`, `chperm.makePrivate.title`, `chperm.makePrivate.body`, `chperm.makePrivate.confirm`, `chperm.makePublic.title`, `chperm.makePublic.body`, `chperm.makePublic.confirm`, `chperm.cancel`, `chperm.busy`, `chperm.saved` |
| Permission refusals | A `role=alert` error in the section or confirm. | `chperm.error.forbidden`, `chperm.error.hidden`, `chperm.error.gone`, `chperm.error.unread`, `chperm.error.other` |
| Create private | In the create-channel dialog, a private toggle and, when on, a checklist of roles below the viewer's, or the no-roles note. | `chperm.create.private`, `chperm.create.privateHint`, `chperm.create.roles`, `chperm.create.noRoles`, `chperm.create.tooMany` |
| Lost access and cannot send | A channel that leaves the list (hidden from the viewer, or deleted: the client cannot tell which) is left with a polite, neutral announcement. In a channel where the viewer lacks send messages the message box stays, read-only, with the reason, and the state is announced once. | `chperm.lostAccess`, `chperm.cannotSend` |
| Role mention and pins | The composer offers roles as `@name` with the secondary "role". A rendered role mention shows its name. A pin whose pinner may not pin there is hidden, and the pins list carries the note. | `mention.role`, `mention.role.secondary`, `perm.pinsNote` |
| Server notification rows | One row per server in notification settings: mode (default, all messages, mentions, nothing), mute, and ignore @everyone and @here. | `serverNotify.title`, `serverNotify.body`, `serverNotify.mode.default`, `serverNotify.mode.all`, `serverNotify.mode.mentions`, `serverNotify.mode.nothing`, `serverNotify.mute`, `serverNotify.suppressEveryone` |

## 1280×800

Roles is in the People group of the fullscreen server settings workspace. Navigation and content scroll independently, as specified in [Flow 18](18-fullscreen-settings.md). The roles list fills the content pane, one row per role with its colour dot, name, member count and actions at the row end. The role editor is a dialog; its name, colour, toggles and permission grid sit in one column and only the grid scrolls, under a pinned footer with save and cancel. The assign dialog opens from a member row's menu in the member list. The channel permissions section sits in channel settings below the name, with the private toggle at its top and the entries listed beneath.

## 360×740

The grouped settings index opens Roles as a single section, with Back returning to the index and the app tab bar hidden throughout settings. Role rows stack: name and count above, actions below, with primary touch targets at least 44 px. The role editor and assign dialog fill the viewport width; the permission grid is one column and scrolls inside the dialog while the footer stays pinned. Member actions are available in the Members section and from the contextual member drawer; nested dialogs remain above their opener. The channel permissions section is a full-width column and each entry's allow, default and deny control wraps under its name. Nothing needs horizontal scroll at 200 % zoom.

## Keyboard map

| Where | Keys | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PermissionGrid, toggle mode | Tab, Space | Tab moves between rows; Space toggles the focused row. |
| PermissionGrid, tri mode | Tab, arrow keys | Tab enters a row on its checked radio. The arrow keys move and select within the row, wrapping from the last to the first. Tab leaves the row. |
| ColorSwatches | Arrow keys | The arrows move and select, wrapping. |
| CheckList | Tab, Space | Tab moves between boxes; Space toggles. |
| Member row | Shift+F10 | Opens the row menu, which holds `roles.menu.assign`. |
| Roles list rows | Tab, Enter | Tab moves across each row's buttons; Enter activates. |
| Composer `@` | ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter, Tab | The arrows move through the options; Enter or Tab inserts. A role option reads its secondary "role". |
| Dialogs | Escape | Closes the dialog without saving and returns focus to its opener. |

## Focus rules

- The role editor opens on the name field and closes to its opener: `roles.new`, or the row's edit button.
- After a delete, focus goes to `roles.new`.
- After a move, focus stays on the same row's move button, or on its other move button when that one is now hidden.
- The assign dialog opens on the first enabled checkbox, else Done, and closes to the member's menu trigger (through `asideReturnRef` from the narrow drawer).
- The private toggle's confirm opens on Cancel and closes to the toggle.
- An entry's settings disclosure keeps focus on its button.
- After `chperm.lostAccess`, focus follows the normal channel-open rule.
- A confirm dialog with an error sets the error in the same update that clears busy; focus goes to the first field, else Cancel, never the destructive button.

## Announcements

All are polite, through the announcer inside settings while the workspace is open, or the shell announcer for contextual actions outside settings. Dialog errors are `role=alert`.

- `roles.moved`
- `roles.editor.saved`
- `roles.editor.created`
- `roles.deleted`
- `roles.assign.given`
