# Flow 05 — trust, search and device-local polish

This flow extends Flow 04's shell order: skip link → rail → channel list → header → log → composer → status bar. Chrome labels use lower case; ceremony and dialog copy uses sentence case. Every visible phrase below comes from the Copy table, with `{name}` filled from the contact's display name or username. Frame boxes describe width constraints, not pixel-perfect components.

## States

| state | shown action | worker fact | announcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| First seen here — not verified | `privacy.firstSeen` under the state; Compare with {name} | pin exists, verified=0, changedUmk=null | Privacy heading |
| changed | Compare with {name}; alert cannot dismiss; the composer of each conversation with that contact is blocked with the same text | changedUmk is validated pending key; sendBlocks[channel] is E_UMK_CHANGED, not own | `privacy.changed` |
| changed, no key to compare | alert cannot dismiss, no Compare; the composer is blocked with the same text; a validated Remove of the changed device ends it per conversation | blocked=E_UMK_CHANGED, changedUmk=null; sendBlocks[channel] is E_UMK_CHANGED, not own, and no changed member of the conversation has a key | `privacy.changedNoKey` |
| failed device in a conversation | composer blocked with the reason; no Verify; a refused edit, reaction, delete or pin shows the same reason | sendBlocks[channel] is E_DEVICE_UNLISTED, E_DEVICE_REVOKED, E_TIER_MISMATCH or E_CREDENTIAL, not own | `privacy.leafFailed` |
| own account: other identity or unlisted device | danger banner in the shell and Devices, no dismiss; its action opens Devices (no compare); the composer of a conversation only own devices block says the same text | account.ownTrust is changed or unlisted; sendBlocks[channel].own (E_UMK_CHANGED: ownChanged, else ownUnlisted) | `privacy.ownChanged` / `privacy.ownUnlisted` |
| unlisted | no Verify | leaf is quarantined | `privacy.unlisted` |
| verified | show the compared key and date | exact current pin verified=1 | Privacy heading |
| no shared group | no Verify | shared=false | `privacy.noShared` |
| history pending | no Verify or send | list read not complete | `privacy.unlisted` |
| validated Remove | sending resumes only in this group; contact stays changed and unverified elsewhere | removed leaf absent from this group's current tree | `privacy.removed` |
| search loading | keep textbox and scope | current request id | `search.loading` |
| search empty | keep textbox and scope | current hits=[] | `search.noResults` |
| search stale | keep destination heading before closing palette | target absent/deleted/quarantined | `search.unavailable` |
| other tab waiting | no conversation view | no matching release/lock yet | `tabs.wait` |
| other tab failed or paused | retry, or the paused heading with `tabs.pausedDetail` and Use this tab | lock still owned or local pause failed | `tabs.failed` or `tabs.paused` |
| other tab in a call (added 2026-10-14, product walk I7) | after Use this tab, the heading `tabs.voiceWarning` with `tabs.voiceKeep` (focused) and `tabs.voiceUse`; keep returns to Use this tab and takes nothing over | the tab holding dilla said, content-free on `dilla-voice:<instance>`, that its call slice is joining, in or paused | `tabs.voiceWarning` |

First sight means first seen **here**, on this device. An instance may withhold newer signed lists, including on first sight; the first pin is not evidence that the list is current. An unknown history leaves the affected leaf pending and its message body unavailable. A validated Remove restores sending only in the group whose current tree no longer contains that leaf. The changed contact key stays unverified in other shared groups. A remote member can provoke repeated changed-key refusals, so a group-local Remove gives the honest sender a way to recover without approving that key.

Search has channel, community and all scopes. Loading retains the textbox and selected scope. An empty current request shows `search.noResults`; an older response cannot replace a newer one. A result opens its channel, then focuses the target row only after the timeline publishes that row. If the target is missing, deleted or quarantined, announce `search.unavailable`, focus a persistent channel heading or palette textbox, and only then remove the overlay. Search hits never expose quarantined text.

Appearance, Keyboard and Diagnostics settings are device-local. Diagnostics displays connection, generation, the instance name (as the status bar shows it), own-device count and the last 20 stable codes with their times; with none it says `diagnostics.empty`. `diagnostics.copy` copies codes only, with no details, tokens or message bodies. Typing is deduplicated by user: one user maps to `typing.one`, multiple users to `typing.many`, even when one user has multiple devices. The other tab has `other-tab` (the `tabs.use` action), waiting, busy, failed, paused and ready phases. Busy keeps the waiting surface while accepted work drains; ready appears only after the old lock releases and this tab acquires it. Failed or paused does not claim release. No follower conversation or message view is rendered.

```

The real dialog renders the **exact 64-hex-character public UMK**, in full, and the pairwise number as **12 five-digit blocks**, separated by single spaces. The repeated `4a` and zero blocks above are layout examples, not a key or number to verify. The dialog identifies the contact and first-seen, changed, verified or unlisted state. For first-seen, `privacy.firstSeen` appears under the state on the Privacy page and in the dialog. Both people independently open Privacy on their own devices and read every block to each other in person or on a call one of them started themselves. A number copied by one person is an aid, not a confirmation; Copy leaves `privacy.confirm` unchecked. The `privacy.verify` button is available only when that checkbox is checked, there is a shared group, and the exact validated pending public key remains the one shown. If there is no shared group, show `privacy.noShared` without Verify.

The browser-tier device depends on code served by its instance. Comparing the safety number outside that instance through this ceremony is the user's available check of the displayed identity; this flow makes no promise about the browser-served code. A malicious instance can freeze the first list seen here. A validated Remove unblocks only this group.

Safety-number QR payload (the contract for a future scanner): `dilla-sn:1:<userId>:<12 blocks joined by "-">`, for example `dilla-sn:1:` + the 32-character user id + `:` + `00001-00002-...-00012`. `1` is the format version. It carries public material only (the user id and the displayed blocks); no key, no session data. It is drawn at 256 px (at least 4 px per module for the 53-module, version 7 symbol), shrinking only to the dialog's width on a phone.

Use Mesh's mono/terminal hierarchy, `--bg`, `--surface`, `--fg`, `--fg-2`, `--edge` and `--accent` roles in `mesh`, `light` and `high-contrast`; the same structure and state text appear in all three themes. At 360 CSS pixels, dialog width is bounded by `max-width:min(100vw - 32px, …)`, the public key wraps, controls wrap inside the viewport, and the viewport has no horizontal scroll. Checkbox, buttons and every close control have targets at least 24×24 CSS pixels. At 200% zoom/reflow, no control or text is lost and every focus ring remains visible: `outline: var(--focus-ring)` with a 2px offset. Reduced motion suppresses transition effects without hiding or changing any state.

## Keyboard map

| starting focus | action | destination |
|---|---|---|
| shell | Control/⌘+K | search textbox, scope preserved |
| conversation | Control+/ | search textbox, channel scope |
| compare opener | Enter/Space | dialog heading, then first control |
| inside compare | Tab/Shift+Tab | next/previous control inside dialog; wraps |
| compare Copy | Enter/Space | Copy button; checkbox stays unchecked |
| compare checkbox | Space | checkbox checked; Verify enabled only if pending key and shared group |
| any top overlay | Escape outside IME composition | surviving opener; dialog closes |
| search hit | Enter/Space | loaded target row, or channel heading if unavailable |
| changed alert action | Enter/Space | compare dialog heading |
| use this tab | Enter/Space | waiting heading, then ready heading only after lock acquisition |

There is no unmodified global shortcut. These shortcuts do not interrupt IME composition. Flow 04's row, toolbar, composer and dialog order still applies beneath these overlays.

## Focus rules

| transition | focus destination | polite status |
|---|---|---|
| compare closes | original Compare button if present, else Privacy heading | no extra text |
| changed alert replaces first-seen row | surviving Compare button | `privacy.changed` |
| validated Remove clears this group's send block | surviving composer in this group if present, else conversation heading; other groups keep their changed-key block | `privacy.removed` |
| search hit disappears | channel heading or persistent palette textbox before unmount | `search.unavailable` |
| tab waits, becomes ready, pauses or fails | heading of the new state or Retry control | `tabs.wait` / ready state / `tabs.paused` / `tabs.failed` |
| paused tab leads again (hand-back, or the other tab closed) | the shell's usual focus | none |
| compare approved | Privacy heading | no extra text |
| typing one to many | current conversation; do not steal focus | `typing.one` / `typing.many` |

The compare dialog traps focus and returns it to a surviving opener on close. Activating Compare in a changed alert first focuses the dialog heading; subsequent Tab reaches the first control. If an alert is replaced, focus moves to the surviving Compare control. A tab transition focuses the new state's persistent heading or Retry control, never a removed conversation control.

## Announcements

`role="status"` is polite for search loading/unavailable, typing and tab transitions. A changed-key alert uses the existing alert semantics but does not repeatedly announce on unchanged slices. Cannot-read rows have neutral visible text; their stable code is available only in Diagnostics. At reduced motion, no animation is needed to tell any state apart.
