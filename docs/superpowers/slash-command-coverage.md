# Slash command catalog coverage

This matrix is checked against `packages/client-core/src/commands/registry.ts`.
“Handler evidence” means the production handler is reached with a real in-memory
client/adapter and its result or mutation is asserted. It is not browser evidence.
The shipping-browser evidence is limited to the rows named in
`e2e/web/slash-commands.spec.ts`; other commands remain unit/integration covered.

The catalog guards in `builtin.test.ts` and `bot-handlers.test.tsx` assert that
every built-in and bot catalog entry has a handler. `registry.test.ts` covers
catalog-driven argument and permission validation. Any new `COMMANDS` entry must
be added to this matrix and receive an outcome assertion before it is considered
covered.

## Deliberate browser limits

Slash E2E does not claim that every catalog handler ran in a browser. Music queue
search/playback depends on an external media source and is covered with the
deterministic adapter/unit fixture; browser coverage proves the current joined
voice context, authenticated state read, and private result. Announcement slash
handlers and most moderation/role handlers likewise remain covered by focused
handler tests, while the browser runs a real two-user moderation confirmation
and shipping composer/poll/reminder paths.

## Shared composer interactions

- `CommandComposer.test.tsx`: keyboard picker navigation and Tab selection,
  Enter selection versus execution, two-stage Escape, IME Enter handling,
  multiline/free-text values, named argument validation, stable entity IDs,
  and uncertain-result draft retention.
- `CommandHost.test.tsx`: built-in production dispatch, command availability
  after context/permission changes, unknown slash remaining private until the
  explicit literal action, and stable request IDs across intentional retries.
- `slash-commands.spec.ts`: the shipping app mounts the real picker/options and
  handlers; it selects a command through the picker, runs private and public
  outcomes, sends unknown and `//` text explicitly, and keeps main/thread drafts
  separate. These browser claims do not extend to every handler in the catalog.
