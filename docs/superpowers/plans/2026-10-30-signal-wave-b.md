# Signal wave B: real-app parity, command picker, the seven differs, polls — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** The shipping web client matches the Signal prototype in the states wave A never compared, gains the
prototype's `/` command picker with inline field chips and private results, its New poll dialog and poll card, and
fixes the seven wave A screens known to differ — all on backends that already exist.

**Architecture:** Task 1 adds a parity mode that shoots the *running* web app (the e2e test host serving
`packages/web/dist`, driven like `e2e/ux/world.mjs`) against the prototype, and every later task proves its screens
with it. New visual pieces live in `packages/ui` (tokens only, stories, `check-stories` for computed style); the web
client wires them to the existing command registry (`packages/client-core/src/commands/registry.ts`), command host
(`packages/web/src/screens/commands/`), bot utilities (`createBotUtilities`: capabilities, polls, reminders) and the
voice/auth screens. No server, core, protocol or Go change: a task that finds it needs one stops and reports
NEEDS_CONTEXT (backend gaps are wave C).

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, React 19, Vite, Storybook 10, vitest, Playwright 1.63, the Go test host
(`target/dilla-testhost`) with the Bot runtime (`target/dillabot`).

**Spec:** `docs/design/signal/README.md` (§6.1 command picker, §6.2 private result, §6.3 poll card, §7.2 new
components, §9 APIs; **its §10 token table wins**), `docs/design/brief.md` (merged Signal brief) and
`docs/design/brief-signal.md` (handoff record). Reference build: `docs/design/signal/prototype/Dilla Signal
Prototype.dc.html` (`startAt=app` / `startAt=signin`, `device=phone`); the command picker is `CMDS`, `cmdMatches`,
`sugsFor`, `runCommand`, `exec` and the composer template (lines ~326–350, ~855–1010, ~1320–1360); the poll dialog
is lines ~528–545 and `pd` (~1380); the poll card ~270–286 and `pollVals`; the private result ~314 and `result()`.
Decisions and rulings: `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-27-signal-wave-a/progress.md` (do not relitigate) and Jonas's wave B
decisions of 2026-10-30 (recorded in the header of this plan's ledger
`.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-30-signal-wave-b/progress.md`, which the controller starts). Coverage input:
`.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-27-signal-wave-a/parity-coverage-audit.md`.

**Process.** This plan comes first, then SDD subagents build and verify task by task (plan → implementer → task
review → fixes). Pixel parity with the prototype is the acceptance condition of every task; any deviation is asked of
Jonas first (implementer reports NEEDS_CONTEXT, the controller asks him with AskUserQuestion). Models: **sonnet** for
fully specified tasks (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9's code), **opus** for Task 2 (replaces a stateful, idempotent execution
flow) and Task 3 (sign-in factor steps, authentication), and **opus for every task review** (parity is a key review);
haiku only for Task 9's prose.

### Wave B scope check: what wave A already shipped from the B list

| B-list item (wave A plan, "Waves") | status | where it shipped |
|---|---|---|
| NowPlaying ×3 | **shipped in A** (Jonas 10-27, Task 8b) | `packages/ui/src/NowPlaying`, dock row, stage bar, Glenn's card |
| RemindersPopover with tabs | **shipped in A** (Jonas 10-27, Task 6b) | `packages/ui/src/RemindersPopover` (Due / Upcoming); empty state never compared → Task 1 pair |
| CodeBlock | **shipped in A** (Ruling AF, Task 7) | `packages/ui/src/CodeBlock`; "Copied" never compared → Task 1 pair |
| SharePicker shell | **shipped in A** (Jonas 10-28, Task 8) | `packages/ui/src/SharePicker`, full options |
| SensitivityMeter UI | **shipped in A** (Task 10b) | `packages/ui/src/SensitivityMeter`; mic test running never compared → Task 1 pair |
| StageFilmstrip | **shipped in A** inside `CallStage` (focused layout strip, Task 8) | whole-voice-desktop-focus matches; no separate component (YAGNI, no visible change) |
| PersonContextMenu | **partly**: volume, Mute for me, Copy username (Jonas 10-28) | the rest of "what exists" → **Task 4** |
| CommandPicker restyle into `ui` | open | **Task 2** |
| BotResult inline card | open | **Task 6** |
| ReactionTooltip shell | open | **Task 8** (see Questions, Q6) |
| Polls (dialog + card; Jonas 10-30) | open | **Task 7** |

Wave C stays out: kick/ban confirm modal and "Not confirmed" (unless Q4 pulls it in), drag-to-move, Glenn move /
disconnect, server mute / move / disconnect, reactor identities, reminder snooze, 10 files per message.

## Global Constraints

- **Pixel parity, signal theme** (Jonas 2026-10-27, restyle-rules §0): match the prototype exactly — control borders
  `--control-edge` family (`#2A303A` / `#252A33` / `#3A404A` as the prototype draws them), solid status dots,
  prototype phone sizes, no visible controls the prototype lacks (extra functions go to invisible routes: context
  menus, shortcuts), text colours as the prototype even below 4.5:1 (scoped story-level axe exception naming the
  element, Ruling Y). Light and high-contrast keep accessible values. The only accepted deviations are sample data
  and features deferred to wave C; everything else is asked of Jonas first.
- **The prototype wins over README prose** where they disagree (Ruling M); copy is final and verbatim from the
  prototype (curly quotes and apostrophes as drawn, `’`, `“ ”`, `…`), sentence case (Ruling AJ, T, AA); fix only real
  grammar errors (Ruling AN).
- Every value comes from a token; no hex, rgb or px colour literal in component CSS; `npm run check:css` green. A
  prototype value the scale lacks becomes a token (Ruling K) — never snap to the nearest one. Token additions go in a
  `// Task <N>` block at the end of each object in `packages/design-tokens/src/tokens.ts` with their test, then
  `npm run build -w @dilla/design-tokens`.
- Real token names, not brief names: `--fg-strong #B9BFC8`, `--fg-2 #8C939E`, `--fg-3 #767D89`, `--fg-4 #5C636E`,
  `--fg-body #D5DAE1`, `--ok` (live), `--surface-hi` (selected), `--hover #14171C`, `--line-strong #2A303A`,
  `--ease-out`. Count badges use `--mention` (Ruling O).
- Icons only from `packages/ui/src/Icon/icons.ts` (Lucide 1.57.0). A missing one is vendored from the
  `lucide-static@1.57.0` tarball (Ruling AJ); if 1.57.0 has no such icon, stop and report NEEDS_CONTEXT.
- Phone = shell width < 770px; inputs 16px text (no zoom); prototype phone sizes; keyboard hints hidden on phone
  (prototype `dLabels`).
- Story titles use the repo prefixes (`Primitives/`, `Shell/`, `Conversation/`, `Voice/`, `Settings/`, `Search/`,
  `Media/`, `Form/`, `Ceremony/`); stories use no timers; a story receives exactly the props `packages/web` passes
  for that state (restyle rule 3d).
- Layout and computed-style assertions go in `packages/ui/scripts/check-stories.mjs` (real Chromium), never vitest
  (Ruling C). Vitest is for behaviour, DOM and attributes.
- Every seeded fixture and every paired app state must be reachable from the shipping client.
- Silent encryption and the brief's exclusion list stay as in `docs/design/brief.md`.
- No backend change in wave B (no Go, Rust, protocol, migration). A needed one → NEEDS_CONTEXT.
- **Gates, every task**, from the worktree root, simple single commands (the worktree guard refuses `cd x && y`):
  `npm test` (root), `npm run build -w @dilla/web`, `npm run build-storybook -w @dilla/ui` then
  `npm run test:storybook:ci -w @dilla/ui` (check-stories), the task's named e2e
  (`npm run test:e2e:web:chromium -w @dilla/e2e -- <specs>` / `test:e2e:voice:chromium`), and `go test ./...` only
  if Go changed (it should not). A lane task runs everything except browser e2e; the controller runs its e2e in the
  worktree after merging (lane-rules).
- **Parity, every task**: the task's app-parity spec in `docs/design/signal/parity/app/task-<N>.json`, shot with
  Task 1's app mode into `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-30-signal-wave-b/parity/task-<N>/`, whole screens (desktop
  1280×800 and phone 390×844) of every state the task touches plus the five standing whole screens (desktop chat,
  members open, voice focus, phone list, phone conversation). The implementer reads every `.pair.png` after the last
  change and reports a table `pair → match | deviates: <what, which task owns it>`. Never `match` unseen.
- Parallel lanes follow `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-27-signal-wave-a/lane-rules.md` (own copy, own git, own Storybook
  port, own parity world base from Task 1's `--base`). Disjointness is stated per task below.
- Reports: `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-30-signal-wave-b/task-<N>-report.md`; commits end with
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`; implementers never dispatch subagents.

## Review Focus

1. **A pasted or autofilled code** ("123 456", "123456\n", iOS/Android one-time-code autofill) must fill all six
   boxes, drop non-digits and submit once — test in Task 3 (`CodeBoxes.test.tsx`, `SignInFactor.test.tsx`).
2. **Enter pressed twice, or Enter while a run is pending** must start one invocation; a retry of an uncertain run
   reuses its `requestId` exactly as `CommandHost` does today — test in Task 2 (`CommandPicker.test.tsx`
   `enter twice runs once`, `retry keeps requestId`).
3. **Esc with filled chips** must leave command mode with the draft `/remind in 1 hour bring two ropes` (values
   joined, empty ones dropped), and Backspace in an empty first chip must leave with `/remind` — test in Task 2.
4. **A capability switched off while the picker is open** (owner turns Polls off in another tab) must drop the
   command from the list on the next capability read, and running an already-open chip form for it must end in the
   existing "unavailable" failure, shown as a failed private result — test in Task 2 (list) and Task 6 (result).
5. **Single-choice poll vote changes and withdrawals** — clicking another answer moves the vote, clicking your own
   pick withdraws it (empty set), clicks on a closed poll do nothing, and a vote racing a close shows the closed card
   — test in Task 7 (`PollCard.test.tsx` in web).

---

### Task 1: Real-app parity mode, and the 19 never-compared wave A states

Disjoint: runs alone first (every later task depends on it). Model: sonnet; review opus.

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/design/signal/parity/shoot.mjs`, `docs/design/signal/parity/shoot.test.mjs`,
  `docs/design/signal/parity/README.md`, `e2e/ux/world.mjs`, `e2e/ux/run.mjs`, `e2e/ux/README.md`
- Create: `docs/design/signal/parity/app/wave-a-gaps.json`, `docs/design/signal/parity/app/standing.json`
- Output (git-ignored scratch): `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-30-signal-wave-b/parity/task-1/`,
  `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-30-signal-wave-b/findings.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (spec format, used by every later task): a pair has `prototype` as today and **either** `story` **or**
  `app`:
  ```ts
  type AppSide = {
    who: 'ada' | 'bjorn' | 'mira' | 'phone' | 'fresh' | 'freshPhone'; // world browser over CDP, or a new signed-out context
    path?: string;            // goto before steps; `{invite}` expands to state.invitePath
    steps?: Step[];           // today's step kinds plus { goto: string } and { totp: [selector, who] }
    clip?: string;
    reset?: string;           // path reloaded after capture (default: `path`, else the URL before steps)
  };
  ```
  Output names `<name>.prototype.png`, `<name>.app.png`, `<name>.pair.png` (app right).
- Produces (CLI): `node docs/design/signal/parity/shoot.mjs <spec> <outDir> --app [<state.json>]` (default state
  `target/ui-screens/signal-b/state.json`); `--storybook` keeps working; a spec may mix story and app pairs.
- Produces (world): `npm run ux:world -w @dilla/e2e -- --base <n> --out <dir>` — host `n`/`n+1`, SFU `n+2`/`n+4`,
  CDP from `n+10` (phone `n+19`); defaults keep today's 8611 layout but out dir `target/ui-screens/signal-b`. The
  world also starts the Bot runtime (reuse `hostArgs` / `startBotRuntime` from `e2e/web/support/host.ts`) and installs
  the Bot through Server settings → Bot as `e2e/web/bot-runtime.spec.ts` does, with Polls and Reminders on; writes
  `state.people.<who>.totp` (already) and `state.botName`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tool tests** in `shoot.test.mjs`: `validateSpec` accepts a pair with `app` and no `story`,
  rejects both or neither, rejects an unknown `who`, accepts `{goto}` and `{totp:[sel,who]}` steps and rejects a
  malformed `totp`; `appUrl(state, '/c/x?i={invite}')` expands `{invite}` from `state.invitePath`; output file stems
  are `.app.png` for app pairs. Run `node --test docs/design/signal/parity/shoot.test.mjs` → FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: Implement** `shootApp(state, pair, out)` in `shoot.mjs`: `who` in `state.cdp` →
  `chromium.connectOverCDP`, first `http` page, `goto` path; `fresh`/`freshPhone` → own context at
  `state.publicUrl` (1280×800 / 390×844, fonts routed, reduced motion, scale 2). Same `settle`, `runSteps`, `capture`
  as the story side; `totp` fills `nextCode(state.controlUrl, state.people[who].totp)` (import from
  `e2e/web/support/totp.ts`); after capture press Escape twice and reload `reset`. Note in the README that the
  app's sample data (Midgard Crew, Ada/Björn/Mira/Liv) differs from the prototype's and is not judged.
- [ ] **Step 3:** `world.mjs` gains `--base`, `--out`, the Bot runtime and Bot install; `run.mjs` reads the same
  `--out`. Build (`go build -o target/dilla-testhost ./cmd/dilla-testhost`, `go build -o target/dillabot
  ./cmd/dillabot`, `npm run build -w @dilla/web`), start the world in the background, wait for `READY`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Specs.** `standing.json`: the five standing whole screens. `wave-a-gaps.json`: one whole-screen pair
  (plus a component crop where the state is small) for each of the 19 states, numbered by the audit:
  #3/#4 sign-in recover and done (`fresh`, totp step); #11 auth on phone (`freshPhone`); #16 reminders popover empty
  (both tabs); #24 status menu desktop and #96 phone You → Status; #44 reply-jump flash (shot mid-flash with
  `wait`); #47 GIF picker; #49 tray with image previews and uploading cards; #52 sent image / GIF / file messages;
  #53 code-block Copied; #71 desktop and #99 phone not-joined preview, nobody here; #75 focused-tile full-screen
  button; #79 PTT listening and #80 mic test running; #83 Roles → New role; #85 Devices → remove another browser;
  #87 phone members sheet; #89 phone message toolbar on tap; #90 phone emoji, GIF picker and tray; #97 phone Home DM
  list and DM conversation; #102 phone settings Profile, Sign-in, Devices, Keyboard, Overview. Prototype props and
  steps come from the audit's "how to reach it" column.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Shoot both specs with `--app`; read every pair. Write `findings.md`: one row per pair,
  `pair | match | differs: <what>` with the owning task by area — auth → Task 3, voice → Task 4, conversation
  (composer, tray, feed, reply, GIF, code block) → Task 8, everything else → Task 5. A finding that is not a defect
  of the shipping UI (sample data, capture timing) is marked `accepted: <why>` only if it is one of the Global
  Constraints' accepted classes; otherwise it is a finding.
- [ ] **Step 6:** `node --test docs/design/signal/parity/shoot.test.mjs` → PASS; root `npm test` → PASS; stop the
  world.
- [ ] **Step 7:** Commit `feat(parity): shoot the running web app against the prototype; wave A gap pairs`.

### Task 2: The command picker (`/` list, inline field chips, suggestions) replaces the old composer flow

Disjoint with Tasks 3, 4, 5 (lanes); runs in the worktree. Blocks 6, 7, 8 (`CommandHost.tsx`, `ComposerArea.tsx`,
`UtilityCommandProvider.tsx`). Model: **opus**; review opus.

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/ui/src/CommandPicker/{CommandPicker.tsx,CommandPicker.css,CommandPicker.stories.tsx,CommandPicker.test.tsx}`,
  `packages/web/src/screens/commands/CommandPicker.tsx` (replaces `CommandComposer.tsx` + `.css`, deleted),
  `packages/web/src/screens/commands/picker-catalog.ts`, `packages/web/src/screens/commands/capabilities.ts`
- Modify: `packages/ui/src/index.ts`, `packages/ui/src/Icon/icons.ts`, `packages/ui/scripts/check-stories.mjs`,
  `packages/web/src/screens/commands/{CommandHost.tsx,UtilityCommandProvider.tsx,copy.ts}`,
  `packages/web/src/screens/conversation/ComposerArea.tsx`, `packages/web/src/strings/botCommand.ts`,
  `e2e/web/slash-commands.spec.ts`
- Test: `packages/web/src/screens/commands/CommandPicker.test.tsx` (moved from `CommandComposer.test.tsx`, which is
  deleted), `picker-catalog.test.ts`, `capabilities.test.ts`, `CommandHost.test.tsx`, `CommandLifecycle.test.tsx`
- Parity: `docs/design/signal/parity/app/task-2.json`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (`@dilla/ui`):
  ```ts
  interface CommandListItem { id: string; icon: IconName; name: string; args: string; description: string; source: string }
  interface CommandListProps { id: string; items: readonly CommandListItem[]; activeId: string | null; showHint: boolean;
    labels: { title: string; hint: string; noMatch: string; sendAsText: string }; query: string;
    onActive(id: string): void; onPick(id: string): void; onSendAsText(): void }
  interface CommandFieldProps { label: string; optional: boolean; value: string; placeholder: string; active: boolean;
    invalid: boolean; ghost?: boolean; listId?: string; activeOptionId?: string; inputRef?: React.Ref<HTMLInputElement>;
    onChange(value: string): void; onFocus(): void; onKeyDown(e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>): void }
  interface CommandSuggestion { id: string; label: string; sub?: string; avatar?: { name: string }; icon?: IconName }
  interface CommandSuggestionsProps { id: string; title: string; items: readonly CommandSuggestion[]; activeId: string | null;
    onActive(id: string): void; onPick(id: string): void }
  interface CommandBarProps { icon: IconName; text: string; tone: 'info' | 'danger'; hint?: string }
  ```
  Exports `CommandList`, `CommandField`, `CommandSuggestions`, `CommandBar` (README §7.2's CommandPicker and
  CommandField).
- Produces (web): `CommandPicker(props: CommandComposerProps)` with today's `CommandComposerProps` unchanged (so
  `CommandHost` keeps its draft memory, `requestId` and generation guards); `pickerEntry(command: CommandDefinition,
  botName: string): PickerEntry` where `PickerEntry = { icon: IconName; description: string; args: string; source:
  string; opensForm: boolean; fields: Record<string, { label: string; placeholder: string; suggest: 'member' |
  'duration' | 'when' | 'provider' | 'choice' | 'none' }> }`; `COMMAND_OPERATIONS: Readonly<Record<string, number>>`
  and `useCommandCapabilities(client: CoreClient, communityId: string | null): ReadonlySet<number> | null`
  (from `createBotUtilities(...).capabilities().supportedOperations`, re-read when the composer opens command mode and
  every 30 s while it is open; `null` while unknown).
- Consumes: `COMMANDS`, `commandAvailability`, `validateCommandArgs`, `parseCommand` (client-core);
  `parseReminderTime`, `resolveReminderTimeCandidate` (web utility); the existing `suggest` providers (members,
  roles, channels, music search for `query-or-url`, polls, reminders).

Behaviour to build (prototype values; the implementer reads the template for every size and colour):
- `/` at the start of an empty-or-slash draft opens the list above the composer (`sModal` 180ms, radius 10, header
  "Commands" + "↑↓ move · tab complete · esc close"), filtered by `startsWith` then `includes` of the command id; rows
  40px with a 26px icon tile, `/name` bold, args in `--fg-3` (`<required>`, `[optional]`, `min..max` for a bounded
  number, "opens a form" for `poll create`), description 10.5px `--fg-2`, a source tag "built-in" or the bot's
  display name (`state.botName`, "Glenn"); selected row `--surface-hi` with a 2px accent inset bar.
- No match: "No command matches {draft}" + "Send as text" (posts the draft literally).
- ↑/↓ move, Tab or Enter picks; Esc clears the `/` list draft. Picking turns the composer into chips; a command
  without fields shows one ghost chip "press ↵ to run". `poll create` opens the poll dialog instead (the existing
  `PollCreateDialog` until Task 7).
- Chip: label tile (accent when active, red when invalid), input sized `max(len(value), len(placeholder), 4)ch +
  16px`, active ring `0 0 0 3px` accent-soft (danger-soft when invalid); optional fields' label ends in "?".
- Suggestions above the active chip (width `min(340px, 100% − 32px)`), titled Members / Durations / When /
  Suggestions / Commands: members = the community's people minus you and bots, avatar + name + `@handle`, filtered
  by `eligibleModerationTarget` for moderation commands as today; durations "10 minutes", "1 hour", "1 day", "7 days"
  (+ "permanent" for `/ban`); when "in 1 minute", "in 10 minutes", "in 1 hour", "tonight 20:00", "tomorrow 09:00",
  each with its exact preview (`Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-GB', { weekday: 'short', day: 'numeric', month: 'short',
  hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit', timeZoneName: 'short' })`, e.g. "Fri 30 Oct, 20:00 CET"); a DST-ambiguous
  time lists both candidates with the existing `reminder.timeChoice` copy; `provider` kinds use today's providers.
- Keys in a chip: ↑/↓ move in suggestions; Tab accepts the highlighted suggestion when the value is non-empty and not
  an exact match, else moves to the next chip; Shift+Tab previous chip; Enter accepts likewise (not for
  `query-or-url` and numbers), else runs; Esc leaves keeping the draft (Review Focus 3); Backspace in an empty chip
  goes to the previous chip, or leaves with `/name` from the first.
- Command bar above the chips (11px): the description; music commands add " · {room}" or " · join voice first";
  moderation adds " · checked against your roles"; a `when` chip with a value shows "Reminds you {preview}" or
  "Try “in 1 hour” or “tomorrow 09:00”"; an error replaces the line in `--danger` with `triangle-alert` and marks its
  chip invalid (see Q1). Hint "tab next field · ↵ run · esc leave" on desktop only.
- Validation messages (prototype copy): "{label} is required", "No member called {value} here", "Try “in 1 hour” or
  “tomorrow 09:00”", "Between 1 minute and 365 days from now", "A whole number from 0 to 100" (from the option's
  min/max), otherwise today's `validateCommandArgs` messages.
- Enter runs only when the chips validate; one run at a time (Review Focus 2). `//` at the start posts the rest with
  one leading `/` (`//shrug` → `/shrug`).
- Visible commands: today's `definitions` (scope, permission bits, handlers present) **and**, for `provider: 'bot'`
  commands, their operation in `useCommandCapabilities` (`null` → bot commands hidden). `COMMAND_OPERATIONS`: music
  `play` 12, `pause` 13, `resume` 14, `skip` 15, `stop` 16, `queue`/`nowplaying` 10, `seek` 17, `volume` 18, `shuffle`
  19, `repeat` 20, `queue remove` 21, `queue move` 22, `queue clear` 23, `music`/`music help` 10; `rolepanel create`
  31; `announcement *` 50/51/51/52; `poll create` 70, `poll results` 71, `poll vote` 73, `poll close` 74; `remind`
  80, `reminders list` 81, `reminders cancel` 82, `reminders dismiss` 83.
- Catalog copy: for the commands the prototype lists, its icon, description, field labels and placeholders verbatim
  (`help` circle-help "List commands, or explain one"; `me` sparkles "Post an action in italics", text "packs the
  rope"; `shrug` smile "Appends ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ to your message"; `play` play "Play the first YouTube result, or a link,
  in your voice channel", "song, video or playlist"; `pause`, `resume`, `skip` skip-forward "Skip to the next track",
  `stop` square "Stop and clear the queue", `queue` list-music "Show what plays next", `volume` volume-2 label
  "0..100" placeholder "60"; `poll create` vote "Ask the channel a question"; `remind` alarm-clock "A private
  one-time reminder", "in 1 hour" / "bring two ropes"; `reminders list` bell "Open your reminders inbox"; `kick`
  user-x "Remove someone from the server"; `ban` ban "Ban for a while, or for good", "permanent"; `timeout` timer
  "Stop someone sending or speaking for a while", "10 minutes"; `warn` triangle-alert "A private warning, logged in
  modlog", "what happened"; optional fields "optional"). Every other registry command keeps its registry
  description and takes the icon from the table in Q2. Copy lives in `picker-catalog.ts`; the client-core registry
  is not edited.
- `/remind` runs from its chips: the `ReminderCreateDialog` is removed; the run passes `{ when, text, timezone:
  browser zone, chosen }` to today's reminder handler. `/reminders list` opens the bell popover on Upcoming.

- [ ] **Step 1: ui failing tests** (`CommandPicker.test.tsx`): CommandList renders `role="listbox"` with
  `aria-activedescendant`, rows named "/remind, A private one-time reminder"; the no-match row offers a "Send as
  text" button; CommandField marks `aria-invalid` and `data-active`; CommandSuggestions calls `onPick` on mousedown
  (keeps input focus). Stories `Conversation/CommandPicker`: List, ListFiltered, NoMatch, Fields, FieldSuggestionsMembers,
  FieldSuggestionsWhen, FieldError, NoFields, Phone. check-stories: list 260px max height, row ≥ 40px, chip ring
  values, phone hint hidden. → FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: web failing tests**: `picker-catalog.test.ts` (prototype copy for the listed commands; `args` for
  `ban` is "<user> [duration] [reason]", `volume` "<0..100>", `poll create` "opens a form"); `capabilities.test.ts`
  (hides `poll create` without op 70, keeps `poll vote` with 73; hides every bot command while `null`);
  `CommandPicker.test.tsx` (moved suite kept green where behaviour is unchanged, plus: `enter twice runs once`,
  `retry keeps requestId`, `esc keeps filled draft`, `backspace leaves from first chip`, `double slash posts
  literal`, `tab accepts suggestion`, `ambiguous time lists both candidates`, `capability dropped while open`).
  `e2e/web/slash-commands.spec.ts`: `/remind` via chips creates a reminder that appears in the popover's Upcoming;
  `/shrug` posts; `//x` posts `/x`. → FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** the ui pieces and the web `CommandPicker`, catalog, capabilities; wire into
  `CommandHost` and `ComposerArea` (the chips replace the composer's input row in place, the composer box keeps its
  Signal frame); delete `CommandComposer.*` and `ReminderCreateDialog`; vendor missing icons.
- [ ] **Step 4:** `npm test -w @dilla/ui`, `npm test -w @dilla/web` → PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5: Parity** `task-2.json` (app side `mira` in #general, `phone` for phone): list open (`/`), filtered
  (`/re`), no match (`/xyz`), `/remind` chips empty, when-suggestions, both chips filled with the "Reminds you" bar,
  field error, `/kick` member suggestions, `/pause` ghost chip, `/me` and `/shrug` results in the feed, phone list
  and chips; plus the standing screens. Iterate until each matches.
- [ ] **Step 6: Gates** (Global Constraints) with e2e `slash-commands conversation layout keyboard phone`.
- [ ] **Step 7:** Commit `feat(ui,web): Signal command picker with inline field chips`.

### Task 3: Auth — six-digit code step, passkey and backup links, the whole sign-in and new-account flows

Disjoint (lane): auth screens only. Parallel with 2, 4, 5. Model: **opus** (sign-in factor steps); review opus.

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/ui/src/CodeBoxes/{CodeBoxes.tsx,CodeBoxes.css,CodeBoxes.stories.tsx,CodeBoxes.test.tsx}`
- Modify: `packages/ui/src/index.ts`, `packages/web/src/screens/SignIn.tsx`,
  `packages/web/src/screens/factor/FactorSetup.tsx`, `packages/web/src/strings/{factorSignin.ts,factor.ts}`,
  `e2e/web/{second-factor.spec.ts,required-factor.spec.ts,signin-order.spec.ts,signup.spec.ts}`,
  `e2e/web/support/totp.ts` helpers if a selector changes, `e2e/ux/world.mjs` (its TOTP fill), `e2e/scripts/shoot-docs.mjs` (same)
- Test: `CodeBoxes.test.tsx`, `packages/web/src/screens/{SignInFactor.test.tsx,OnboardingFactor.test.tsx}`
- Parity: `docs/design/signal/parity/app/task-3.json`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `CodeBoxes(props: { id: string; label: string; value: string; onChange(value: string): void;
  onComplete?(value: string): void; invalid?: boolean; describedBy?: string; autoFocus?: boolean })` — one real
  `<input inputMode="numeric" autoComplete="one-time-code" maxLength={6}>` over six drawn boxes (prototype
  `codeBoxes`; the box at the caret gets the accent edge); `onComplete` fires once when the sixth digit lands.
- Consumes: Task 1's `totp` step.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests.** `CodeBoxes.test.tsx`: typing "12a3" keeps "123"; pasting "123 456" gives
  "123456" and calls `onComplete` once (Review Focus 1); six boxes are `aria-hidden`, the input carries the label.
  `SignInFactor.test.tsx`: the code step renders CodeBoxes and the links "Use a passkey" (only when this account
  has a passkey and the browser can use one) and "Use a backup code"; a complete code submits once.
  `OnboardingFactor.test.tsx`: FactorSetup's TOTP step uses CodeBoxes. → FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: Implement**; the links switch to today's passkey and backup-code steps (no new route; a link
  whose route the account lacks is hidden, never dead — Ruling AR precedent). Update the e2e and world helpers that
  `fill` the old single code field.
- [ ] **Step 3: Parity** `task-3.json` (`fresh` / `freshPhone`): sign-in credentials, code step, recover ("Add
  this browser"), done; new account invite, account, recovery key, second factor choice, code step, done (via
  `{invite}`); each at desktop and phone. Iterate to match; Task 1's auth findings are fix steps here.
- [ ] **Step 4: Gates**; e2e `second-factor required-factor signin-order signup passkey enrol`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit `feat(ui,web): six-digit code boxes and the Signal sign-in and new-account steps`.

### Task 4: Voice — your own voice menu, the rest of the person menu, the AFK page

Disjoint (lane): `packages/web/src/screens/voice/*`, `packages/ui/src/PersonContextMenu`, `packages/ui/src/CallStage`
(AFK slot only). Parallel with 2, 3, 5. Model: sonnet; review opus.

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/web/src/screens/voice/VoiceView.tsx` (`personMenu`, `AfkPage`),
  `packages/ui/src/PersonContextMenu/*` (Move-to group), `packages/web/src/strings/{afk.ts,stage.ts}`,
  `packages/ui/src/Icon/icons.ts` if needed, `e2e/web/afk.spec.ts`, `e2e/voice/controls.spec.ts`
- Test: `packages/web/src/screens/voice/{VoiceView.test.tsx,VoiceView.wb2.test.tsx}`,
  `packages/ui/src/PersonContextMenu/PersonContextMenu.test.tsx`
- Parity: `docs/design/signal/parity/app/task-4.json`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `PersonContextMenuProps.move?: { label: string; rooms: readonly { id: string; name: string; count:
  number }[]; onMove(id: string): void }` (prototype "Move to" block: heading, volume-2 icon, name, count).
- Consumes: `voiceShortcutText()` (`voice/shortcuts.ts`), the profile-card opener and the DM opener the member menu
  already uses (`MemberCardHost`), the composer mention insert from Ruling (Jonas 10-28 "Mention"), the roles
  settings route.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests.** Own row/tile menu (in a call): "Mute"/"Unmute" with hint `⌘⇧M`/`Ctrl+Shift+M`,
  "Deafen"/"Undeafen" with `⌘⇧D`/`Ctrl+Shift+D`, "Profile", "Move to" listing the community's other voice channels
  with occupant counts (joining moves you), "Leave voice" (danger); no Copy username. Another person's menu: volume,
  then "Profile", "Message", "Mention", "Mute for me" (check), "Copy username", "Edit roles" (only with Manage
  roles); Glenn keeps volume, Mute for me, Copy (Move/Disconnect are C). AFK page: moon tile, title "Nobody is
  away" / "You are away", the explainer line, button "Go AFK" / "Come back" (Q3 decides what the latter does and the
  title with others away); no roster list. → FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: Implement.** The explainer reads the community's AFK timeout from `afkRead`'s `timeoutSeconds`:
  "After {minutes} minutes idle in voice, a computer is moved here. Phones are never moved." — first confirm in
  `useCall.tsx` that phones are never moved; if they are, stop (NEEDS_CONTEXT).
- [ ] **Step 3: Parity** `task-4.json`: own menu (desktop row, tile, phone long-press), another person's menu,
  Glenn's menu, AFK page empty and away, desktop and phone; Task 1's voice findings are fix steps here.
- [ ] **Step 4: Gates**; e2e web `afk layout`, voice `controls stage join-talk phone-call`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit `feat(web,ui): Signal own voice menu, person menu items and AFK page`.

### Task 5: Parity sweep — Task 1 findings outside the area tasks

Disjoint (lane) once routed: only files of findings owned by Task 5 (settings, phone shell, reminders popover, status
menu, palette, toasts). Parallel with 2, 3, 4; the controller checks the findings' files against 2/3/4 before
dispatch and moves any overlap to the owning task. Model: sonnet; review opus.

**Files:** the components and web call sites named in `findings.md` rows owned by Task 5; their stories and
check-stories rules; `docs/design/signal/parity/app/task-5.json`.

- [ ] **Step 1:** For each Task 5 row of `findings.md`, write the failing test that pins the difference where it is
  behaviour or DOM (vitest) or computed style (check-stories), with the prototype's value.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Fix each in the component or the web call site (restyle rule 3d: change the app, not the story).
- [ ] **Step 3: Parity** re-shoot every Task 5 pair from `wave-a-gaps.json` plus the standing screens into
  `task-5/`; each row of `findings.md` it owns becomes `fixed (commit)` or a question for Jonas.
- [ ] **Step 4: Gates**; e2e `search-settings phone layout panes keyboard`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit `fix(ui,web): wave A parity gaps found in the running app`.

### Task 6: Private results — the BotResult card in the feed

After Task 2 (same `CommandHost.tsx`). Parallel lane with Task 7. Model: sonnet; review opus.

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/ui/src/BotResult/{BotResult.tsx,BotResult.css,BotResult.stories.tsx,BotResult.test.tsx}`,
  `packages/web/src/screens/commands/private-results.ts`
- Modify: `packages/ui/src/index.ts`, `packages/web/src/screens/commands/{CommandHost.tsx,CommandPicker.tsx,copy.ts}`,
  `packages/web/src/screens/conversation/Conversation.tsx`, `e2e/web/slash-commands.spec.ts`
- Test: `BotResult.test.tsx`, `packages/web/src/screens/commands/private-results.test.ts`, `CommandHost.test.tsx`
- Parity: `docs/design/signal/parity/app/task-6.json`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (`@dilla/ui`):
  ```ts
  type BotStatus = 'pending' | 'success' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  interface BotResultProps { author: { name: string; avatarName: string; shape: 'bot' | 'circle' }; time: string;
    status: BotStatus; body: React.ReactNode; onDismiss(): void;
    labels: { status: Record<BotStatus, string>; onlyYou: string; dismiss: string; tag: string } }
  ```
  Chip per README §6.2 / prototype: pending loader spinning 900ms "Working" `--accent-2` on `--accent-soft`; success
  check "Done" `--ok` on a new `okResult` token `rgba(124,255,142,.1)`; failed x "Failed" `--danger` on
  `--danger-soft`; cancelled "Not confirmed" `--fg-3` on `--hover`; then eye "Only you can see this" and "Dismiss" in
  10.5px `--fg-3`. The row is a MessageRow first-row layout with the 30px `--r-bot` avatar and the tag.
- Produces (web): `privateResults(client: object, account: string, conversation: string): { rows(): readonly
  PrivateResult[]; add(row: Omit<PrivateResult, 'id'>): string; update(id: string, patch: Partial<PrivateResult>):
  void; dismiss(id: string): void; subscribe(listener: () => void): () => void }` with `PrivateResult = { id: string;
  at: number; status: BotStatus; text: string; provider: 'builtin' | 'bot' }` — in memory, per client, account and
  conversation (like `CommandHost`'s draft memory), gone on reload, as in the prototype.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests.** BotResult: each status renders its icon and label; Dismiss calls `onDismiss`;
  the status chip is `role="status"`. `private-results.test.ts`: rows are per conversation; dismiss removes;
  another account sees none. `CommandHost.test.tsx`: a run adds a pending row with the prototype's pending text
  (e.g. "Saving your reminder…"), the handler's result turns it success/failed with the handler's message; the
  composer footer live text (`runningPrivately`) is gone; an unknown `/xyz` sent with Enter adds a failed row
  "/xyz isn’t a command here. To post it as text, start with //." (Review Focus 4: the unavailable failure from a
  dropped capability lands here). → FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: Implement**; rows render after the last message in `Conversation.tsx`, in time order, with the
  existing entrance animation; `uncertain` per Q5; the author per Q7.
- [ ] **Step 2b: Kick/ban confirm (Q4).** `/kick` and `/ban` open the prototype's confirm modal (avatar, "Kick {name}
  from {server}?", Duration for ban, Logged note, Kick/Ban and Cancel; no Reason field for kick until C). Confirm runs
  the existing command path; Cancel adds a "Not confirmed" (`cancelled`) private result. Client only: if the modal
  needs a server change, stop and report. Tests: the modal renders per prototype, Confirm runs once, Cancel adds the
  row and runs nothing; parity pairs for the modal and the Not confirmed row.
- [ ] **Step 3: Parity** `task-6.json`: pending, success (`/remind`), failed (`/play` outside voice: "Join a voice
  channel first. Glenn plays where you are."), unknown command, desktop and phone, plus standing screens.
- [ ] **Step 4: Gates**; e2e `slash-commands conversation bot-runtime`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit `feat(ui,web): private command results as Glenn's inline card`.

### Task 7: Polls — the New poll dialog and the poll card

After Task 2 (`UtilityCommandProvider.tsx`). Parallel lane with Task 6 (disjoint: poll files only). Model: sonnet;
review opus.

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/ui/src/PollCard/{PollCard.tsx,PollCard.css,PollCard.stories.tsx,PollCard.test.tsx}`,
  `packages/ui/src/PollDialog/{PollDialog.tsx,PollDialog.css,PollDialog.stories.tsx,PollDialog.test.tsx}`
- Modify: `packages/ui/src/index.ts`, `packages/web/src/screens/commands/{PollCard.tsx,UtilityCommandProvider.tsx,UtilityCards.css}`,
  `packages/web/src/strings/utility.ts`, `e2e/web/slash-commands.spec.ts` (or the poll spec it holds)
- Test: `PollCard.test.tsx`, `PollDialog.test.tsx` (ui), `packages/web/src/screens/commands/PollCard.test.tsx` (new)
- Parity: `docs/design/signal/parity/app/task-7.json`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (`@dilla/ui`):
  ```ts
  interface PollCardOption { text: string; pct: number; mine: boolean; winner: boolean; voters: readonly { name: string }[] }
  interface PollCardProps { question: string; closed: boolean; multi: boolean; meta: string; options: readonly PollCardOption[];
    canVote: boolean; canClose: boolean; busy?: boolean; labels: { closed: string; close: string };
    onVote(index: number): void; onClose(): void }
  interface PollDraft { question: string; answers: string[]; duration: '1h' | '4h' | '8h' | '24h' | '3d' | '7d'; multi: boolean }
  interface PollDialogProps { open: boolean; channelName: string; bot: { name: string }; value: PollDraft; error: string | null;
    canPost: boolean; onChange(next: PollDraft): void; onPost(): void; onCancel(): void }
  ```
- Consumes: `PollSummary` (`counts`, `myChoices`, `closed`, `dueAt`, `createdAt`, `creatorId`, `multi`), the
  vote/close/voters operations already in `packages/web/src/screens/commands/PollCard.tsx` and the create path in
  `UtilityCommandProvider.tsx` (`DURATIONS`, byte checks).

Prototype values: dialog 520px at 12vh (phone `calc(100% − 24px)` at 20px), header bot tile + "New poll in
#{channel}" + close; "Question" with "{n} / 300" (danger above 300), placeholder "What should we raid on Friday?";
"Answers" with "2–10", numbered rows with placeholders "the bridge", "the harbour", "another answer", remove ×
(disabled-looking at two), "Add answer" up to 10; "Open for" segmented 1h 4h 8h 24h 3d 7d (default 24h); toggle
"Allow several answers"; error line with `triangle-alert`; footer "Voters are shown by name. Anyone can change or
withdraw their vote.", "Cancel", "Post poll" (accent only when the question is set and ≥ 2 answers). Errors in
order: "Write a question", "Questions are at most 300 characters", "Add at least two answers", "Answers are at most
100 characters", then today's duplicate and size messages. Toasts "Poll posted", "Poll closed". Card: vote icon +
question (+ "CLOSED" tag), one row per answer with a fill bar to its percentage (`--accent-soft`-family fill
`rgba(90,168,230,.2)` for your pick, `rgba(124,255,142,.12)` for a closed winner, `rgba(255,255,255,.05)` otherwise —
tokens), border accent for your pick, round check (square when multi), up to five 18px voter avatars with names on
hover, "{pct}%"; meta "Open for 24 hours · pick one · 3 voters" / "Final results · pick any · 1 voter"; "Close poll"
for whoever may close.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests.** ui PollCard: percentages round like the prototype (`Math.round(count / votes ×
  100)`), winner weight 700 only when closed and the max count > 0, `onVote` not called when closed, voters capped
  at five. PollDialog: the remove button is inert at two answers, "Add answer" gone at ten, the counter turns danger
  past 300, Post calls `onPost`. web `PollCard.test.tsx`: single choice switches (choices `[1]`), clicking your pick
  sends `[]`, multi toggles within the set, a vote rejected because the poll closed refreshes to the closed card
  (Review Focus 5); the meta's duration comes from `dueAt − createdAt`; voter avatars come from the first voters page
  per answer (Q8 decides the multi-choice voter count). `/poll create` from the picker opens the new dialog. → FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: Implement**; delete `PollCreateDialog` and the old card markup and CSS.
- [ ] **Step 3: Parity** `task-7.json`: dialog empty, filled, error; card open, voted, multi, closed with winner,
  creator's Close; desktop and phone.
- [ ] **Step 4: Gates**; e2e `slash-commands bot-runtime conversation`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit `feat(ui,web): Signal poll dialog and poll card`.

### Task 8: Conversation — Threads opens the thread, upload toasts and copy, reaction tooltip, conversation findings

After Tasks 6 and 7 (`ComposerArea.tsx`, `Conversation.tsx`). Runs in the worktree. Model: sonnet; review opus.

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/web/src/screens/Shell.tsx` (~2090, the Threads aside), `packages/web/src/screens/conversation/{ComposerArea.tsx,Attachments.tsx,Conversation.tsx}`,
  `packages/ui/src/AttachmentTray/*`, `packages/ui/src/ReactionBar/*`, `packages/web/src/strings/en.ts`
  (`shell.tray.*`), `e2e/web/{threads.spec.ts,conversation.spec.ts}`
- Create (per Q6): `packages/ui/src/ReactionTooltip/{ReactionTooltip.tsx,.css,.stories.tsx,.test.tsx}`
- Test: `ShellThreads.test.tsx`, `ComposerArea.test.tsx`, `Attachments.test.tsx`, `ReactionBar.test.tsx`
- Parity: `docs/design/signal/parity/app/task-8.json`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `ReactionTooltipProps = { text: string; avatars: readonly { name: string }[] }` (prototype: up to six
  avatars and "Ada, Björn and you reacted with 🛡️"), anchored to a reaction chip on hover/focus via `Tooltip`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests.** Threads header button opens a thread directly (Q9 picks which), not `ThreadList`;
  a file over 25 MB stays in the tray as a card with meta "Over 25 MB" in `--danger` and a danger edge, and raises
  the toast "Files over 25 MB can’t be sent from a browser" once per pick; Send while any upload is below 100 %
  shows the toast "Waiting for uploads to finish" and sends nothing; the reaction tooltip shows on hover and focus
  per Q6. → FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: Implement**; remove `shell.tray.tooLarge`'s old sentence; keep 25 MB and the file count (C).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Fix every Task 1 finding routed to Task 8 (reply flash, GIF picker, tray previews, sent
  attachments, code-block Copied) with a pinning test each.
- [ ] **Step 4: Parity** `task-8.json`: Threads → thread aside, tray over 25 MB with its toast, waiting toast,
  reaction tooltip, and every Task 1 conversation pair, desktop and phone, plus standing screens.
- [ ] **Step 5: Gates**; e2e `threads conversation messaging phone layout`.
- [ ] **Step 6:** Commit `feat(web,ui): Threads opens the thread; Signal upload toasts and reaction tooltip`.

### Task 9: Close — user docs, screenshots, release notes, full gates

Last; alone. Model: sonnet (gates, shots), haiku for prose; review opus.

**Files:** `README.md` ("what works" row for wave B), `docs/user/bot-commands.md` (picker, chips, private
results, polls), `docs/user/getting-started.md` (code boxes), `docs/user/voice.md` (own menu, AFK page),
`docs/user/screenshots/*`, `e2e/scripts/shoot-docs.mjs` (new shots: command list, chips, private result, poll
dialog and card, code step), `docs/deploy/releases/unreleased-signal-wave-b.md` (create; becomes
`v0.1.0-signal2.md` at tag time), `docs/design/signal/parity/README.md` (app mode section final).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Re-shoot every app spec (`standing`, `wave-a-gaps`, `task-2`…`task-8`) into `task-9/`; every row
  must be `match` or an accepted deviation recorded in the ledger; anything else goes back to its task.
- [ ] **Step 2:** `npm run docs:shots -w @dilla/e2e`; update the docs listed above (plain verbs, the prototype's
  copy, no Mesh, no pre-Signal dialog descriptions); release notes: what changed for users, "no server change; web
  only", deploy = web assets only (dillad and dillabot unchanged), tag `v0.1.0-signal2`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Full gate:** `npm test`, `npm run typecheck -w @dilla/ui`, `npm run typecheck -w @dilla/web`,
  `npm run typecheck:e2e`, `npm run build -w @dilla/web`, `npm run test:storybook:ci -w @dilla/ui`,
  `npm run test:e2e:web -w @dilla/e2e` (three browsers), `npm run test:e2e:voice:chromium -w @dilla/e2e` → PASS.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Commit `docs: Signal wave B user docs, screenshots and release notes`.

## Lanes and order

| wave | tasks | where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Task 1 | worktree |
| 2 | Task 2 ∥ Task 3 ∥ Task 4 ∥ Task 5 | 2 in the worktree; 3, 4, 5 in lanes (world `--base` 8711 / 8811 / 8911, Storybook 6113–6115) |
| 3 | Task 6 ∥ Task 7 | 6 in the worktree; 7 in a lane |
| 4 | Task 8 | worktree |
| 5 | Task 9 | worktree |

Shared-file watch: `tokens.ts` (lane blocks), `packages/ui/src/index.ts` and `icons.ts` (append-only, merged by the
controller), `Shell.tsx` (Task 4 profile/roles openers vs Task 5 status menu vs Task 8 threads: different hunks;
merge in task order). The controller runs the lane task's e2e in the worktree after each merge.

## Decisions (Jonas, 2026-10-30)

Answered by AskUserQuestion; they bind every task. Q1 prototype (errors in the command bar). Q2 all available
commands with the proposed icons. Q3 default (Come back leaves the AFK channel; "{names} are away"). **Q4 pull the
kick/ban confirm modal and "Not confirmed" into B (Task 6), without a kick reason field; anything that needs the
server stays in C.** Q5 Failed chip with today's uncertain text. Q6 build ReactionTooltip in `ui` now, wire in C.
Q7 Glenn for bot commands, "dilla" with the D tile for built-ins. Q8 count distinct voters. Q9 last opened, else
most active, else the empty aside. Q10 the browser's zone, shown in the preview.

## Questions for Jonas (answered above)

1. **Command field errors: in the bar or under the field?** Your wave B note says "errors under the field" (README
   §6.1 prose); the prototype draws the error in the command bar above the chips (danger line with a warning icon)
   and turns the active chip red. Default in the plan: the prototype (Ruling M).
2. **Icons for commands the prototype doesn't list** (the registry has ~60, the prototype 16). Proposed: `tableflip`
   / `unflip` table, `code` code, `giphy` image, `dm` message-square, `invite` user-plus, `search` search, `topic`
   hash, `thread` messages-square, `reply` reply, `edit` pencil, `delete` trash-2, `pin`/`unpin` pin, `join`
   volume-2, `leave` phone-off, `mute` mic-off, `unmute` mic, `deafen` headphone-off, `undeafen` headphones,
   `nowplaying` music, `seek` fast-forward, `shuffle` shuffle, `repeat` repeat, `queue *` list-music, `music*`
   list-music, `untimeout` timer-off, `unban` ban, `modlog` scroll-text, `role *` / `selfrole *` / `rolepanel create`
   shield, `announcement *` megaphone, `poll vote/results/close` vote, `reminders cancel/dismiss` bell. And should all
   of them show, or only the prototype's 16 plus what a person needs? Default: all available ones, with these icons.
3. **AFK page "Come back", and the title when others are away.** dilla's AFK is a voice channel. Default: "Come
   back" leaves the AFK channel (you are no longer away); with others away and you not, the title reads "{names} are
   away" / "{name} is away" like the not-joined preview's "… are here". Alternatives: rejoin the channel you were
   moved from; or keep "Nobody is away" only for empty and show no title otherwise.
4. **Kick and ban confirm.** The prototype draws a modal (avatar, "Kick Björn from Midgard Crew?", Duration /
   Reason / Logged, Kick) and Cancel gives a "Not confirmed" private result; the wave A plan put the confirm in C.
   It is client-only UI except kick's Reason (the registry's `/kick` has no reason). Pull the modal and "Not
   confirmed" into B (Task 6), without a kick reason field until C? Default: stays in C; `/kick` keeps today's
   confirm until then.
5. **"Uncertain" results** (the run may or may not have happened, e.g. a lost response). The design has pending,
   done, failed and not confirmed. Default: show the Failed chip with today's uncertain message ("…may have been
   created; check …"). Alternative: a fifth chip "Unsure" in `--warn`.
6. **Reaction tooltip without reactor names** (identities are wave C; today the client knows only the count and
   whether you reacted). Default: build `ReactionTooltip` in `ui` with stories now and wire it in web in wave C, so
   the app shows no half tooltip. Alternative: wire now with "You and 2 others reacted with 🛡️" / "3 people reacted
   with 🛡️" and no avatars.
7. **Who authors built-in command results?** The prototype shows Glenn even for `/help`, a built-in, and DMs have
   no Glenn. Default: bot commands show Glenn (bot avatar, BOT tag); built-in results show the same card authored by
   "dilla" with the D tile. Alternative: Glenn for every result in a server, "dilla" only in DMs.
8. **Multi-choice poll "n voters".** The backend gives counts per answer, not distinct voters. Default: for
   multi-choice, read every voters page of each answer to count distinct people (more requests on big polls).
   Alternative: say "n votes" for multi-choice.
9. **Which thread does the Threads button open?** The prototype opens the last thread you had open (or its only
   thread). Default: the thread you last opened in this channel, else the most recently active one; with no thread
   in the channel the button opens the empty thread aside ("No threads yet"). Alternative: keep the thread list when
   the channel has more than one thread.
10. **Reminder time zone.** The old "Set a reminder" dialog had a time-zone field; the chips have none. Default:
    the browser's zone, shown in the "Reminds you Fri 30 Oct, 20:00 CET" preview. Alternative: an optional
    `[timezone]` chip.
